# `tripod-vectors`

Owns the canonical compact-ASH evidence substrate: semantic fixtures,
their independently derived expectations, the mutation registry, the
relation-indexed coverage matrix, and the plan that binds all of them to
one exact linked bundle and one exact transaction ABI (Guide-12 §16–§19).

The package owns evidence, not semantics. Every expectation it states is
derived from the layer that defines the thing being expected — relation
identities come from `realization`, coverage requirements come from
`compiler`, target bytes come from `transaction` over a `linker` bundle —
and none is derived from the candidate being judged.

Nothing here executes a target. A semantic fixture deliberately contains
no target index, program, tapleaf, control block, transaction byte, or
sponsor wallet state (§17.2); materialization is a separate, later step
that reads the bundle and the ABI. Target acceptance and semantic
acceptance are two verdicts, and this package keeps them two (§1.4).

The distinction between a canonical evidence subject and an experimental
one is a type, not a convention. Only a subject admitted into the
`CompactAshEvidencePlan` can carry an evidence-grade claim; anything
constructed ad hoc is typed as experimental and cannot be promoted
without going through the plan's checked constructor (§16.4).
