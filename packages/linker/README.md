# `tripod-linker`

Resolves the typed relocatable backend bundle `tapscript` emits into a
deterministic candidate linked bundle (Guide-12 §14).

The linker owns symbol resolution, the typed reference graph and its
cycle policy, structured relocation, deterministic taptree assembly,
relation-carrier closure, and the linked resource projection. It does
not construct complete transactions, and it does not decide semantics:
every semantic fact it uses arrives inside the validated operation plan
the bundle carries.

Nothing here is final. The output is a `CandidateLinkedBundle`, whose
status is read-only and whose outstanding obligations are structurally
non-empty, because Guide-12 §1.9 keeps the candidate and final states
distinct and the evidence a final bundle would bind does not exist.
