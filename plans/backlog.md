# Tripod Implementation Backlog

> **Status:** ACTIVE
> **Current gate:** Phase 6 — STATE constructor and maturity announcement
> **Current condition:** Phases 1 and 2 are complete. The target-independent compiler constructs one deterministic, validated scoped analyzed program for the complete pilot scope, factorized per operation, with relation-owned requirements, a corruption-resistant assembly validator, and independent assembly oracles; the Phase-2 exit gate record is in §2.11, including passed document reproducibility. Phase 3 then delivered the Guide-8 target foundation, the Guide-9 native primitive gate, the Guide-10 constructor and wide-floor prototypes, and the Guide-11 declassification result, each with its own gate record. Public declassification is no longer an open blocker: an initial policy is selected — an explicit boundary reached by owner-authorized normalization, with the direct and public-committed paths deferred against three named target blockers — and the gate record is in §2.4. Phase-3 exit is recorded: the Guide-12 preflight register closed all sixteen seventh-review rows, and (`gate:phase3:exit`) was checked green on that tree with the record in §2.6. Phase-4 exit is recorded in §2.8: compact ASH ran end to end against a live target with twelve accepted and matched submissions and honest coverage stated at 100 of 211. Phase-5 exit is recorded in §2.20 and §2.21: the live-transfer campaign closed with the amended exit gate met on a countersigned assessment. The current phase is Phase 6 — the STATE constructor and maturity announcement — chartered against Guide 14 as the owner supplied it and archived it verbatim (`T6-001`), with Wave 0 — the tenth static review's disposition and the Phase-5 handoff revalidation — run and closed out in the required order (`T6-002`, `T6-031`) and the owner-issued conceptual preflight register binding Waves 1–13 (`T8-001`), so Wave 1, typed STATE metadata and semantic transition, is the next wave.
> **Next gate:** Phase 6 — announce-maturity end to end through Guide-14 Waves 1–13 (`T8-001`), Wave 1 next
> **Authority:** Current execution queue only. The specification, the realization document, typed architecture, implemented ADRs, accepted decisions, package contracts, phase cards, and accepted research results take precedence.

This file contains only:

- the current repository and readiness state;
- the latest static-review basis and open findings;
- compact historical milestones and gate records;
- the active Phase-2 compiler queue;
- immediate algorithm preparation;
- dependency posture;
- verification and clean-tree requirements.

Detailed historical implementation narratives belong to Git history, annotated
tags, phase cards, ADRs, accepted decisions, and focused evidence records—not
to the active backlog.

## 1. Backlog contract · `sec:backlog:contract`

### 1.1 Authority · `rule:backlog:authority`

This backlog sequences work. It is not protocol, realization, compiler, target,
ABI, evidence, deployment, or release input.

When artifacts disagree:

| Subject | Owner |
|---|---|
| abstract economic interface | the Attestation specification |
| realization meaning, invariants, obligations, and residuals | the realization document |
| finite registries and stable architecture IDs | typed architecture |
| current executable reference behavior | executable model |
| repository engineering policy | implemented ADRs |
| accepted cross-package implementation direction | planning decisions |
| package boundary | package contract |
| phase entry, deliverables, and exit | phase card |
| unresolved design question | research note |
| current task ordering | this backlog |

A lower owner never overrides an upper owner on the upper owner’s subject.

### 1.2 Status vocabulary · `tab:backlog:status`

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **TODO** | Ready when its named dependencies are complete. |
| **IN PROGRESS** | Actively being implemented, reviewed, or verified. |
| **BLOCKED** | A named dependency or correctness defect prevents safe progress. |
| **PARKED** | Deliberately inactive until a concrete consumer or measured need exists. |
| **DONE** | Implementation, focused evidence, required gates, documentation, and clean-tree evidence are recorded. |
| **DROPPED** | Deliberately not implemented; rationale and replacement are recorded. |
| **HISTORICAL** | Immutable evidence about an earlier revision; not a claim about the current checkout. |

Code resembling an intended result is not sufficient for `DONE`.

A static-review finding remains open until one of these occurs:

1. the finding is reproduced and fixed with focused coverage;
2. a typed proof shows the reported state is unconstructible;
3. reproduction shows the finding is false;
4. the owning policy or assurance claim is deliberately corrected.

“Existing tests pass” does not close a finding unless a named test reaches the
reported path.

### 1.3 Priority vocabulary · `tab:backlog:priority`

| Priority | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **P0** | Can manufacture false release, deployment, provenance, or semantic evidence. |
| **P1** | Trusted semantic/evidence boundary defect or active phase blocker. |
| **P2** | Required correctness, determinism, publication, identity, or documentation work before phase exit. |
| **P3** | Maintainability or evidence-quality work required by the active gate. |
| **POST** | Later-phase work that does not block the current gate. |

### 1.4 Definition of done · `rule:backlog:done`

An implementation task is `DONE` only when it records:

1. implementing source files;
2. focused positive and negative tests;
3. affected ADRs, decisions, package contracts, phase cards, or research notes;
4. exact verification commands and outcomes;
5. generated-publication and label impact;
6. semantic, identity, schema, and migration impact;
7. dependency impact;
8. final clean-tree output.

A review finding additionally records whether reproduction confirmed,
refuted, or reclassified it.

A dependency task additionally records:

- selected source and exact version;
- enabled features;
- transitive graph;
- licence;
- MSRV;
- unsafe boundary;
- determinism and parallelism implications;
- advisory status;
- lockfile impact.

A research task additionally records:

- exact question and constraints;
- prototype and tool versions;
- accepted and rejected candidates;
- positive and negative evidence;
- measurements;
- permanent implementation handoff.

### 1.5 Identity admission · `rule:backlog:identity-admission`

No new digest or digest-bearing field enters merely because an object is
important.

A proposed identity must satisfy
(`[ADR021-req:identity:admission-record]`) and name:

- the complete typed object or exact bytes;
- owner and producer;
- a present consumer;
- the exact decision the consumer makes;
- assurance class;
- canonical projection and encoding;
- domain separator and recipe identifier;
- stale conditions;
- migration behavior;
- explicit non-claims.

No named consumer means no digest. No distinct decision means no digest.

---

## 2. Review basis and current evidence · `sec:backlog:review-basis`

### 2.1 Canonical review record · `tab:backlog:review-basis`

The [static-review index](reviews/README.md) is the review record of record
and always names the latest indexed review. The per-finding disposition
register for the Guide-14 arc lives in
[Guide 14 §4](guides/guide_fourteen.md)
((`tab:guide14-exec:preflight`)). Review facts — the reviewed tree, file
census, exclusions, and verdict — live in the indexed review texts, not
here. A review's findings are evidence about its exact tree.

### 2.2 Earlier review basis

Every earlier reviewed tree is listed in the same canonical
[static-review index](reviews/README.md). Historical reviews are evidence
about their exact trees, not current-checkout evidence.

### 2.3 Historical gate records

The completed gate records for Phase 1, the T1–T5 remediation, the P2-004
compiler-input batch, and Guides 2 through 10 stood here as §2.3–§2.14.
They are archived verbatim, with their original numbering and labels, in
[backlog history](history/backlog-history.md), so a reference to §2.8 or
§2.11 anywhere below resolves to the heading of that number there.

### 2.4 Guide-11 declassification gate (archived)

Closed and archived verbatim, with its label, in
[backlog history](history/backlog-history.md) beside the earlier
records; §2.4 references below resolve to the heading of that number
there.

### 2.5 Draft-promotion gate · `gate:backlog:draft-promotion`

The 2026-08-19 batch executed the user's promotion ruling: the
identity-adjudication and interchange drafts take priority as the
disciplines, ADR-016 is deleted rather than kept superseded, every
overlap is deleted rather than restated, and ADR-010 stays untouched as
a different scope. Wave 1 minted [ADR-021](../adr/021-identity-adjudication.md)
carrying only adoption data — the single local recipe convention, the
current-identities table, the separation migration verbatim, the
ADR-011 amendment linkage, and three recorded divergences — and
retargeted all ten imported citations of the retired owner; the
released realization contract took one prose sentence with a three-way
proof no identity moved. Wave 2 minted
[ADR-022](../adr/022-interchange-conventions.md) adopting the
fourth-edition interchange conventions wholesale, stated the ADR-010
boundary one-directionally, restated the executor wire-frame stop from
the identities register with its revisit condition intact, and
discharged DI-005 — the integration queue of §13 is closed. CI-005 was
recorded in the same batch under the user's wall-time ruling.

Gate, content-scoped per the cadence ruling and CI-005: the light lane
registry passed 9 lanes with the two test lanes skipped by design, 331
cumulative seconds inside the runner, 5 m 31 s wall; the corpus checker
oracle passed all four checkers in 5.6 s on the merged tree; the full
workspace suite ran green once, inside Wave 1, immediately after the
batch's only Rust-touching edits, and the delta since is markdown only.
No identity moved: the generated manifest is byte-identical and both
registers regenerate byte-identically. Weight: this record's room came
from archiving the closed Guide-11 gate record to history per the
CI-004 pattern, 9470 bytes net. Lane wall-times, recorded per the
wall-time ruling: Wave 1 two stints (interrupted by a harness restart,
resumed with work intact), final stint 9 m; Wave 2 two stints, final
stint 20 m 19 s; both workers' reports carry their own lane timings.
Found in passing and owed to CI-005: the golden-capture script prints
each checker's exit status but exits 0 itself, so a chained commit can
proceed past a red checker — it did once here, caught on the next run;
the archival also taught that a block moved into history must have its
relative links re-based, which the checker catches as broken links.

### 2.6 Guide-12 preflight and Phase-3 exit gate (archived)

### 2.7 Guide-12 build boundary (archived)

### 2.8 Guide-12 Phase-4 exit gate (archived)

The three Guide-12 gate records are archived verbatim, with their
labels, in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md) under the
Guide-12 records group; a reference to §2.6, §2.7, or §2.8 below
resolves to the heading of that number there. Phase 4 exited at §2.8:
twelve accepted and matched live submissions, honest coverage 100 of
211, the section-29 audit at 94 of 105, the local gate 47 of 47 with
byte-identical document reproduction, and the runtime half of
`G12-R04` discharged from the wave transcripts. Its conditional re-audit still fires when the conservation, normalization, or lifecycle lanes next run live; the intermediate confidential-funding guide's evidence-restart wave now owns that expected firing point.

### 2.9 Guide-13 batch gate (archived)

The Guide-13 batch gate record is archived verbatim, with its label, in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md) under the Guide-13 records group, beside the nineteen Phase-5 wave narratives whose live rows compress to their evidence; a reference to §2.9 below resolves to the heading of that number there. The batch closed 2026-08-24 with fourteen waves merged and the full repository suite green on the shared instance at the batch tip, 48 of 48 meson lanes in 13 m 12 s. The Phase-5 result is the honest stopped one the phase card records: the entire remaining distance to the Phase-5 exit is the two typed blockers — the owner sighash and confidential predecessor funding — both owned by the chartered intermediate confidential-funding guide.

### 2.10 Confidential-funding batch gate (archived)

The confidential-funding batch gate record is archived verbatim, with its label, in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md); a reference to §2.10 resolves to the heading of that number there. The batch closed 2026-08-25, 48 of 48 lanes green in 567.1 seconds at the batch tip, with both Guide-13 blockers this guide was chartered to own resolved and the executed guide archived in [the guides directory](guides/guide_confidential_funding.md).

### 2.11 Interlock resolution and handoff gate (archived)

The interlock-resolution gate record is archived verbatim, with its label, in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md); a reference to §2.11 resolves to the heading of that number there. The step-3/step-4 interlock was ruled unwarranted and discharged with real evidence 2026-08-25, 48 of 48 lanes green in 579.9 seconds, the restart order then typed-stopped at step five.

### 2.12 Shape-wave closing gate · `gate:backlog:ctf-shapes`

The confidential-funding restart's step-five stop was cleared 2026-08-25 (T5-039): split, many-to-many representative, and several-distinct-owners were built as multi-output and multi-input fixtures and accepted by the pinned node, moving six of the ten positive private matrix rows onto observed acceptances of their own shapes; the registry parity search, which no fixture wider than two outputs could pass, was repaired with the two-output rule preserved. The one-output shapes stay typed at the registry floor, the merge-predicate conflict is filed as a guide erratum, and the order now stops typed at step six on the sponsor signer dependency. Two handed-up questions were ruled: the step-six/step-seven chain rule is affirmed strict, and the deterministic-fixture-openings row awaits a determinism-standing member rather than a guide repair. Full suite green at the merge tip: 48 of 48 meson lanes, zero failures, 490.8 seconds of wall time, both validators clean and the register byte-stable. The Phase-5 exit remains unreachable — the explicit positive table is answered in zero of sixteen rows — waiting on the explicit-lane runs, the sponsor dependency, and the minimality pairs behind it. The full narrative is [the wave-seven closeout](history/ctf-guide-wave-7-closeout.md).

### 2.13 Shape-census gate · `gate:backlog:shape-census`

The consensus shape-possibility register landed 2026-08-25 (T5-040) on the discipline that the exact consensus-possible shapes be tracked and every limitation explicitly labeled, pinned, explained, and eventually structurally removed. Eight blinded shapes are censused with separate consensus and first-party verdicts — four observed-accepted on run-of-record identities, three consensus-possible but refused by first-party convention with named removal paths filed as T5-041 and T5-042, and fee-only consensus-impossible by the Pedersen tally — with the consensus half a computed predicate held against every recorded verdict and every refusal recomputed against the live registry. The register records that the two-output floor guards consensus only incidentally, and the private-merge erratum's overstated ground is corrected. The plans weight caps were raised in the same wave — hard cap to 1 MiB, soft target to 693 KiB by the same ratio, the motivating measurement recorded at the constant — and a latent fixture-sizing defect the raise exposed was repaired. Full suite green at the merge tip: 48 of 48 meson lanes, zero failures, 514.7 seconds of wall time, both validators clean and the register byte-stable. The register is [the shape-possibility reference](reference/shape-possibility.md).

### 2.14 Sponsor-arc gate · `gate:backlog:sponsor-arc`

The sponsor arc closed 2026-08-25 across two waves (T5-043, T5-044) with the first observed sponsor-signed acceptance on the live lane. The reserve asset and the fee-role program digest are runtime-threaded beside the protocol asset — the demonstration deployment keeps its literals and its identities, proven byte-identical where an intact baseline existed — and a sponsor-signed explicit control was accepted at a real node with the relay boundary crossed for the first time: the mempool allowed it before the mine, and the node read the bytes back equal. Three refusals were peeled to get there, each typed and each a first-party defect rather than a target property: the unauthorizing signature, the owner census that had no route to a sponsored message, and the fee-role digest that was a fixture constant no program hashes to. The never-raised live sponsor reserve-asset guard is now enforced, SponsorEnvelopeSignerAbsent is cleared at its defining site by its own rule leaving PredecessorConstructorAbsent the one carried residual, the step-7 ordering erratum is filed sharpened by the outcome, and no matrix row moved — the acceptance is a positive explicit control, which answers neither the sponsor-authorization negative nor the confidential sponsor-values row. One acceptance establishes the envelope wire, not production multi-party signing. Full suite green at the arc tip: 48 of 48 meson lanes, zero failures, 459.0 seconds of wall time, both validators clean and the register byte-stable.

### 2.15 Structural-removals gate (archived)

### 2.16 Explicit-table and fee-vocabulary gate (archived)

### 2.17 Sponsor-arc completion gate (archived)

### 2.18 Fee-completion and crossing gate (archived)

### 2.19 Closure-arc gate (archived)

### 2.20 Negative-half gate (archived)

### 2.21 Handoff-and-repair gate (archived)

The seven closed gate records of the section-15 shape, fee, negative-half
and handoff arcs (T5-040 through T5-072) are archived verbatim, with
their labels, in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md) under the
live-transfer arc records group; a reference to §2.15 through §2.21 below
resolves to the heading of that number there. The arcs closed 2026-08-26
and 2026-08-27; the partition at their tip was 108 = 82 answered + 1
vocabulary-closed + 25 still required, each of the twenty-five a final
typed stop against a named gap, and every closing suite green on the
shared instance.

### 2.22 Forward-recapture gate · `gate:backlog:forward-recapture`

The native v2/revision-7 forward recapture closed 2026-08-28 across thirteen waves (`T7-001` through `T7-013`) under the owner authorization that chartered it end to end: run a native revision-7 capture with an enhanced recorder, let that capture become the run of record, and let every recorded-v1 value descend to history as immutable data — moved verbatim, never recomputed, because recomputing a recorded observation is backdating. Two further rulings rode the arc: the narrow schema-6 concept was approved after worked examples (a composite two-acceptance observation for the restart parity pair, witness-path-shape and committed-leaf-arrangement locators, a primary/support link split, and the multi-row semantic witness) and schema 5 was retired outright rather than kept historical, verified against the fact that no committed artifact ever persisted a schema-5 document. `T7-001` gave the executor a capture journal that clones exact request bytes before send and survives errors; `T7-002` built schema 6; `T7-003` the capture driver with its five duties and RUN-REPORT grammar; `T7-004` the enhanced recorder writing every capture before its gates run, with the legacy rendering byte-preserved beside it; `T7-005` retired schema 5. The capture itself took three attempts, each refusal a real catch: attempt one was refused by the recorder's own write-time completeness validator against five multi-operation ceremonies (fact-joining repaired as `T7-006`); attempt two passed 40 of 40 but was refused by two driver false refusals — the diagnostics subtree and a full-tip equality the binary cannot satisfy because elementsd reports a twelve-hex short revision (repaired as `T7-007` under the prefix rule, flagged to the owner without veto); attempt three is ELIGIBLE at the run-of-record suite, forty of forty outcomes, and its eighty-one files stand byte-verbatim in `packages/vectors/fixtures/native-v2-r7-run-of-record/` (`T7-008`, with the strict importer whose eight duties re-decode every byte). `T7-009` bound the corpus through the only retyping path: all forty-two recorded-observation-unbound rows moved atomically as twenty-four native-run, seventeen native-refusal, and one paired-relation observation, census `38+2+1+25+42=108` before, `82+1+25=108` after report validation, outstanding exactly twenty-five, with no v1 value as an equality oracle; its thirteen-round verify walk aligned the report validators to real Elements bytes family by family — leaf version 0xc4, the one-item Schnorr key-path witness with no control block, the real sponsored shape, the R01 0x08/0x09 declared-parity rule, and the exact authorized aliasing forms — always preserving refusal power. `T7-010` minted the two authorized Pending successors from typed corpus projections alone: the private-restart two-acceptance link and the atomic proof-bearing schema-2 record, whose one substantive walk stop was a false equality the corpus refuted — the issued asset is distinct from the predecessor coins' asset. `T7-011` performed the descent: `live_history_v1` became the sole historical namespace through re-exports that resolve to the original declarations, so byte preservation holds by construction; every consumer's current claim moved to typed corpus projections, every historical claim names history explicitly, the no-active-v1-reads audit passes, Q19 forward pins stayed active while the v1-inequality assertions descended — with the recorded fact that the fresh capture reproduces the historical maximum-inputs txid exactly, so v1-versus-v2 inequality is not an oracle and none was invented. `T7-012` finished the native harness's own succession: its six seams all proved to be current claims, the private-restart pending fallback died with the mint Recorded, and the recorder machinery stayed byte-compatible. `T7-013` repaired what only the full gate could see: the descent's new file was outside the ADR-014 declared census (a package-scoped verify is structurally blind to the meson census — filed as the arc's process finding), registered with a 227-declared-to-227-tracked empty diff, alongside one near-miss span rewording. THE CLOSING GATE IS GREEN: forty-nine of forty-nine meson lanes, zero failures, 883.7 seconds of wall time, the register unchanged at twenty-five, and the twenty-five still-required grounds fingerprint-pinned. The rows `T7-001` through `T7-013` flip DONE under this record.

### 2.23 V1-descent epilogue · `gate:backlog:v1-descent-epilogue`

The recapture arc's epilogue closed 2026-08-28 on one strategy — re-point, then delete to git history — across two waves. `T7-014` made the physical location match the naming: every v1 literal declaration moved byte-verbatim from its origin module into thirteen registered `live_history_v1` child files, the bridging re-exports deleted, the origin modules left v2-only with the forward records at `live_private_restart::forward_v2`; the raw classifier's fifty-two historical reads were re-pointed path-only, proven by reproducing the parent file byte-for-byte when the new prefixes are reversed, and the byte-equality regression blocks stayed identical to their pre-move bytes. `T7-015` then deleted the record from the working tree: the fifteen-file history namespace including `live_closeout.rs` (whose only content was the Wave 5–8 reconstructions), fifty-five archival tests including the three Q19-divergence archives, and every stranded v1-era helper; the raw classifier's `RecordedObservationUnbound` standings now carry kind facts only — names and the 24/17/1 split with no identities, details, or relation strings — while all three census identities hold byte-for-byte (`38+2+1+25+42`, `80+2+1+25`, `82+1+25`, each `=108`); `ProofBearingRunOfRecord` relocated type-only into the current module; four current tests re-fixtured from the validated corpus, the pair-arc width now decoding each acceptance's real transaction weight; and the zero-v1-values sweep checked all sixty-two unique hex payloads of the former namespace absent from source and tests, the two surviving strings carrying independent v2 provenance only. The keep set — rerun-day bytes and parser, the corpus `HistoricalV1`/`Revision6` arms, the forward records, the byte-unchanged live harness, closed plans prose — is green throughout, and the meson census stands at fifty-six declared equal to fifty-six tracked. Net movement: 524 insertions against 7,143 deletions. THE CLOSING GATE IS GREEN: forty-nine of forty-nine meson lanes, zero failures, 483.0 seconds of wall time. Git history is the sole archive of the v1 record; the native v2/revision-7 corpus is the only run of record in code. The rows `T7-014` and `T7-015` flip DONE under this record.

### 2.24 Typed-closure and erratum gate · `gate:backlog:typed-closure-errata`

The no-capture half of the negative-half closure program closed 2026-08-29 across three waves (`T9-001` through `T9-003`), chartered end to end by rulings settled before any wave opened: the four register adjudications — the member-then-coordinator leaf arrangement assigned to `member-coordinator-leaf-exchange` with the arrangement itself as separator, `wrong-coordinator` read as an arrangement fault and therefore an adjudicated duplicate, the §15.6 confidential-sponsor-values fault listing struck as the guide's own error against its §15.2 positive twin, and the ABI-validation row ruled mis-typed against a status vocabulary whose only member is `Candidate` — plus a batch erratum approval covering every boundary and ground retyping, each argued on the merits at its site with adjudication provenance in the landing commits. `T9-001` built the vocabulary: three typed-closure boundary kinds beside the operation-vocabulary closure — architecture closure with four no-catch-all proof arguments, typing correction, adjudicated duplicate — three standings outside the run-owed denominator with zero census buckets, report schema 7 whose rejection set now pins the historical 6 and the tripwire 8, and the `family_range_defects` fault validator registered unwired; census-neutral, both register pins untouched. `T9-002` consumed it: six rows left the run-owed register through their adjudicated members — the ASH destination closed by the constructor-table key, the surjection proof by the mandatory hybrid form, the fee-role carrier by the demonstration shape set with its deployment scoping stated, the witness reorder by the ABI order constant, the ABI-validation row by typing correction, and wrong-coordinator as the duplicate — register 25 to 19, buckets 4+1+1, the fingerprint re-pinned through the sanctioned discovery round, and the layerless set pinned at exactly seven named rows. `T9-003` closed six more through the first-party routes: foreign-sponsor-asset, two-sponsor-envelopes and unclassified-u discharged — the last by a genuine staged `family_range_defects` call demanding the exact `PositionUnaccounted` defect, repairing the real hazard that the discharge dispatcher copies the validator label without dispatching on it — and sponsor-member-unclassified, output-claimed-through-two-flows and confidential-sponsor-values recorded as first-party facts on their existing deciding tests; the retained amount row's false no-chain-mints-such-a-coin ground was struck for the honest `MutantBuilderOwed`; register 19 to 13, discharge census 34 to 37, fact census 3 to 6, answered 82 to 88, the fingerprint re-pinned to 0x053e_323b_8934_f2b5, every census identity crossing to 108 throughout. The verify walks ran 4, 3 and 5 server rounds; the two missed report consumers each round caught were repaired by recomputation, never by copying the observed value. The full gate first REFUSED the record: the three evidence rows pushed the maintained plans class 271 bytes over its hard cap, answered by the standing archival ritual — the seven settled live-transfer arc records (§2.15–§2.21) moved verbatim to history, reclaiming roughly 18.9 KiB. THE CLOSING GATE IS GREEN: forty-nine of forty-nine meson lanes, zero failures, 635.3 seconds of wall time. The register stands at THIRTEEN, every departure a typed closure or a first-party answer, and the thirteen remaining grounds are fingerprint-pinned; the capture half — eight drivable rows riding one revision-8 capture — is the arc's second act.

### 2.25 Tripod positioning wave · `gate:backlog:tripod-positioning`

The repository's self-description inverts: Tripod, a contract closure compiler, is the product, and the attestation contract is the exemplar that proves its build-out — the specification keeps its authority over the contract's meaning, and the record the contract manufactures stays the contract's product. The wave lands in ordered, gate-coherent commits: (1) positioning prose; (2) the imported-citation prefixes follow the documents they name — the specification's consumer prefix becomes `A-` (the paper's title carries the name) and the realization document's becomes `RZ-`, a version-free prefix that survives version movement; anchor names are hashed prefix-stripped, so neither hash nor the anchor-set pin moves. (3) the version- and frame-bearing filenames retire — `docs/attestation/realization.md`, `plans/labels/realization.md`, `plans/labels/specification.md` (a version in a filename would churn census, fixtures, and partition on every version movement), every path reference moving in the same commit. (4) THE ATOMIC RE-PIN: the specification releases at v1.0.0 (title *Attestation*, changelog comments removed under the released policy, PDF `Tripod_Attestation_v1.0.0.pdf`); the two own-division label areas become `attestation` and `realization`, so two anchor names move and the anchor-set hash is re-pinned by the recorded ceremony (retired value reproduced before the new one was taken); the manifest binding renames to `specification` (a hashed key, so the semantic hash moves in the same commit); and `realization_version` becomes the tracked binding `0.6.0-dev` under the rewritten law — the binding gate derives the expected value from the workspace version, the denotation gate pins the behavioural hash, unchanged across the wave and its regression witness. The gate test carries the scheme-migration record; the identity register carries DI-008. The behavioural hash is the wave's regression witness and must not move; the semantic and anchor-set hashes are expected to move exactly once, in the atomic commit, by the recorded re-pin ceremony.

### The verification harness's two standing hazards · `rem:backlog:verification-harness`

A verdict is read from the report wrapper's own report line, never from a pipeline's shell status: the wrapper propagates its exit code faithfully, and a pipe to a filter truncates the status to the last stage's. And a single shared build-target directory is poisoned when checkouts of two different commits build the same crates into it, so a lane that moves between commits pins a target directory of its own.

### Publication metadata · `rem:backlog:publication-metadata`

The published documents carry their attribution and their terms: the attribution position names Proof Commons, a commons rather than a company, and the document set is dedicated to the public domain. A specification exists to be reproduced, cited and implemented, and an attribution condition taxes exactly that use, so the attribution that matters is the one the title page carries. The rights line states the dedication, the licence-URL field names the canonical deed for machine readers, and the document licence file holds the legal code verbatim.

### The crates carry the product's name · `rem:backlog:crate-naming`

Each crate manifest and the build system's project name the product, so the product the repository describes is the product its artifacts are named after. The name feeds nothing that hashes, exports or gates: the versioning derivation reads the version alone, the binary and library target names are their own, and the generated model artifacts never carried it.

### The realization's fixed body states its law · `rem:backlog:law-delimitation`

The realization's fixed body states the law without restating the era. The versioning law leaves its worked example to the masthead, which prints the live binding; the hash pins defer to the algorithm the attached envelope names; and the schema discriminants are read at their carriers — the envelope for the architecture manifest, the canonical query context for the wire, the bound profile for deployment. The workspace authors field names the publishing organization.

### The shared crate's acknowledgement · `rem:backlog:cli-common-thanks`

The shared command-line crate's README thanks the developers whose work inspired the tooling. Gratitude for inspiration, stated once, naming no repository and claiming no lineage: the crate's own manual remains the authority on what it does.

### The tip's tests assert their own consistency · `rem:backlog:tip-convergence`

The release profile's identity test derives its expected value from the profile itself rather than comparing against a hand-pinned constant, so the tree asserts its own internal consistency instead of a value a reader would have to take on trust. The paper is Attestation, the product is Tripod, and the protocol object is the attestation contract.

### The licence terms and their citation families · `rem:backlog:licence-convergence`

The code licence is stated once, in the licence file, and the manifest key, the toolchain licence rule and the dependency comments agree with it rather than restating it a second way. The dependency-review clauses name what a dropped feature pulled in and which rule refuses it, which holds under any workspace licence, and the toolchain record says why a copyleft workspace strengthens rather than relaxes the permissive-dependency rule. Documents stay under the public-domain dedication.

### The hash-citation audit the lint suite runs · `rem:backlog:hash-citation-audit`

The audit holds every published hexadecimal value to the identity rule, as a labels binary in the lint suite wired exactly as the forbidden-text check is: it asks git for the complete tracked set and requires every value to be described by a rule in the citation-families table, which names what each kind of value measures and the program that writes it. The audit places rather than recomputes — whether a digest is right belongs to the test that owns it — and what it establishes is that every value has an owner on the record.

### The cut the settled records carry · `rem:backlog:record-cut`

A planning record earns its place by what it establishes, so the passages that spent themselves on a document's own corrections are gone and what survives argues the result. A citation is a promise that a reader can fetch what it names, so the sites that cited tags no hub carries name the phase cards and the archived record as the durable record, with nothing hash-shaped substituted. The archive index states its rule for when a settled record may be edited at all, and states it there rather than here: a wave record that paraphrases a rule it does not own carries a second copy of it, and the copy stops being true the moment the rule is sharpened.

### The discipline every published value follows · `rem:backlog:hash-citation-discipline`

Every hexadecimal value the tree publishes declares how a reader establishes it: recomputable from bytes the tree carries under a named algorithm, resolvable to a referent a reader can fetch, or defined by something other than its author. A value that nothing regenerates, nothing resolves and nothing defines stands nowhere, including inside an encoded rendering, which a decode-and-assert check reads. The cascade above the captures recomputes from the bytes it is taken over, and each chosen constant is a derivation from a string published beside it.

### The separators spell the product's name · `rem:backlog:separator-convergence`

A domain separator is hashed input that identifies a recipe, and the product's name is part of that identity. Each separator spells it at the version it carries, because no projection, encoding or algorithm moved. The identities that follow those bytes are re-taken by the tree's own generator rather than edited, so the typed pin, the generated artifacts, the realization's envelope and the versioning gate carry one result.

### 3.2 Current published identities · `tab:backlog:identities`

Exact hash and version values are deliberately not duplicated here. Read each
identity from its authority:

| Identity | Authority |
|---|---|
| Specification version | `papers/attestation/main.tex` and `sections/00_title.tex` |
| Architecture schema, semantic/behavioural algorithms and hashes, anchor-set hash | `packages/model/generated/architecture.json`, checked against typed architecture |
| Realization version (tracked binding) | `docs/attestation/realization.md` masthead |
| Attestation wire schema | typed model/architecture constants |
| Deployment-profile schema | typed architecture constants |

The generated architecture publication is authoritative. Planning prose must
not become a competing identity source.

Architecture finality does not imply:

- complete realization scope;
- compiler completeness;
- target support;
- linked bundle or ABI existence;
- deployment evidence;
- production readiness.

## 5. Current static-review findings · `sec:backlog:findings`

### 5.1 Summary · `tab:backlog:findings-current`

| ID | Priority | Status | Finding |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `T6` | P1 | DONE | External-evidence relations bypassed abstract capability validation during proof planning. |
| `T7` | P1 | DONE | Representation-relation proof choices were not constrained by the selected representation mode. |
| `T8` | P2 | DONE | Current-phase declarations disagreed and the plan checker did not detect all copies. |
| `T9` | P2 | DONE | Compiler status documentation materially understated implemented internal analysis. |

All four findings were reproduced or directly corrected, repaired, and
verified in the Guide-4 batch; the gate record is in §2.8. Their evidence
records follow. Implementation detail beyond these records belongs to Git
history. The later two-pass review recorded in §2.1 opened the SR2 findings
in §5.2.

### 5.2 Closed review registers

The finding registers of the second, third, fourth, and fifth static
reviews stood here as §5.2–§5.5. Every row was remediated and closed, in
the Guide-7, Guide-8, Guide-9, and Guide-10 preflight waves
respectively. They are archived verbatim, with their original numbering
and labels, in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md), so a
reference to §5.3 below resolves to the heading of that number there.


### 5.6 Sixth-review findings

The sixth static review’s finding register stood here. Every row was
remediated and closed in the Guide-11 preflight and declassification
waves. It is archived verbatim, with its original numbering and its
label, in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md), so a reference
to §5.6 below resolves to the heading of that number there.


### 5.7 Confidential-value target review · `tab:backlog:findings-ct-review`

The Guide-11 §5 target review read the confidential-value machinery at
merged tip `78499c2`, upstream base `b7fc5d0`, and landed its accepted
facts as typed Rust in `packages/target-elements/src/confidential.rs`
with human provenance in (`tab:elements-ref:review-ct`). The twenty
questions the guide sets are all answered from source.

The review's own numbering note: the preflight arc in §5.6 already
spends the label "Wave 5" on the row that closed `G11-H01`. This record
belongs to the guide's §5 execution, a different arc, and is filed by
content rather than by wave number.

Three dispositions come out of it, and one is a negative result that the
guide asks not to be softened.

| ID | Priority | Status | Finding |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `G11-C01` | P1 | DONE | The confidential encodings record whether the y coordinate is a quadratic residue, while the curve-checking primitives accept only the compressed public-key prefixes, which record whether y is odd. The two conventions select different points, so no pattern may be carried from one to the other by analogy. Typed as `PointParityConvention`. |
| `G11-C02` | P1 | DONE | The commitment relation is the conceptual one with both terms positive: the blinder multiplies the base point and the amount multiplies the asset generator. The opening scalar is thirty-two bytes big-endian, refused at or above the group order, admitted at zero. Typed as `CommitmentRelation`. |
| `G11-C03` | P0 | OPEN | An authenticated public opening has no complete on-script form under the reviewed revision. Three independent blockers are named and typed as `OpeningBlocker`; the capability stays `Unsupported` for that reason. This is the §11 disposition input and it is a review result, not a scope decision. |

`G11-C03` is the row every later declassification candidate must be
judged against. The blockers are that the asset generator cannot be
derived on-script, that the confidential and curve-primitive encoding
domains do not meet, and that a witness-supplied parity byte is bound to
nothing, so a relation a program could verify holds for a point or its
negation. Candidate C in the guide names parity as load-bearing; this
review supplies the source reason.

Two questions are recorded as OPTIONAL follow-ups rather than as
findings, because neither changes a typed fact.

| ID | Priority | Status | Item |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `G11-C04` | OPTIONAL | OPEN | The capability contract calls commitment equality `Unsupported`, which is exact for a primitive: no reviewed instruction compares two commitments. Byte equality over the exposed canonical items is nonetheless a composition a backend might build, and the guide's disposition vocabulary has a name for that state which the typed enum does not carry. Deciding whether `ConfidentialCapabilityState` should gain the backend-pattern and named-blocker states belongs to a wave that owns the contract shape, since the states are part of the versioned schema. |
| `G11-C05` | OPTIONAL | OPEN | Value introspection presents an absent value as an explicit zero, prefix `0x01` over eight zero bytes, so a program cannot distinguish an absent field from a zero one at that primitive. No current pattern depends on the difference. Recorded so that one which does is not written in the belief that the distinction survives. |

The typed facts are deliberately not wired into `TargetDefinition`.
Growing that schema is a versioned change under
(`rule:guide11-exec:target-version-honesty`), and this review states
facts rather than revising a contract shape; the contract version did
not move.

### 5.8 Dependency decision and commitment oracle (archived)

The Guide-11 dependency decision and the independent commitment
oracle record are archived verbatim, with their labels, in [backlog
history](history/backlog-history.md); references resolve there. The
decision to add nothing was later revised by the user's 2026-08-20
ruling recorded in section 2.7, which adopted the reference crates
as testing oracles.

### 5.9 Seventh-review preflight findings

The seventh static review’s preflight register stood here. Its sixteen
rows are the Guide-12 preflight identifiers `G12-R01` through
`G12-R16`; fifteen are CONFIRMED and DONE and `G12-R08` is
RECLASSIFIED and DONE, so the blocking rule
(`gate:guide12-exec:preflight`) is satisfied and no confirmed P0 or P1
row remains open. Wave 0 adjudicated and reproduced, and Waves 1a, 1b,
and 2 repaired: each row’s witness was written to assert its defect and
was flipped by the wave that fixed it. The register is archived
verbatim, with its numbering and its label, in [backlog
history](history/backlog-history.md), so a reference to §5.9 or to its
label resolves there. Guide-12 preflight dispositions themselves are
owned by the guide’s own table.

### 5.10 Phase-5 closing-arc adversarial review · `tab:backlog:findings-r5`

An external adversarial review of the phase-5 closing arc, archived at [plans/reviews/review-9-0.5.17-dev.md](reviews/review-9-0.5.17-dev.md). It performed no build, no test and no node run; its evidence is the tree it read.

Its central verdict was that the exit gate could not be signed: two of the fifteen rows asserted more than the tree supports. The owner accepted both of its gate amendments, and the `T5-071` gate-repair wave executed them and remediated every finding. EVERY ROW BELOW WAS RECOMPUTED AT THE WAVE'S OWN BASE BEFORE ANY REPAIR — a review is evidence about the tree it names, not an instruction — and the recomputation moved two figures the review reported, because the handoff arc that landed between the reviewed tip and the wave's base answered two more rows.

| ID | Finding | Priority | Verified at source | Status |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `R5-001` | Exit-gate row 4 asserted "complete safety evidence" and "eighty-one observed or first-party-established" beside a canonical completeness predicate the classifier reports as FALSE. | P0 | YES | DONE |
| `R5-002` | Exit-gate row 12 asserted that mixed-program vectors reject, where the architecture can state no such vector and no layer ever produced a verdict. | P0 | YES | DONE |
| `R5-003` | The native owner-signing lane did not bind the recorded refusal details, the control's acceptance, or the run-of-record constants. | P1 | YES | DONE |
| `R5-004` | The two typed leaf-partner grounds predicted the exact verdict words an unbuilt mutant would draw, which no in-repo source establishes. | P1 | YES | DONE |
| `R5-005` | Comments claimed seven distinct field ranges where two rows share one and separate by shape, and a non-claim called the bare-u mutant the only script-path verdict. | P2 | YES | DONE |
| `R5-006` | Section 2.20's filed process finding named the wrong separating fact for the eighth same-verdict row. | P2 | YES | DONE |
| `R5-007` | The gate record said nine waves closed while five of them still read ACTIVE. | P2 | YES | DONE |
| `R5-008` | The closing assessment re-minted the exit-gate colon-label in prose instead of citing it, which the register validator refuses as a duplicate mint. | P2 | YES | DONE (hotfixed) |
| `R5-009` | The orchestrator's exit-time record claimed both plans validators clean at the reviewed tip while validator 2 was in fact RED there with the `R5-008` duplicate mint — a false green in the records. | P1 | YES | DONE |
| `R5-010` | Section 15.4's `key-path-escape` row declared a script-path boundary a key-path spend can never reach. Recorded as an ERRATUM rather than a review finding. | P1 | YES | DONE |

**`R5-001` and `R5-002` are the two amendments.** Both NARROW what the gate claims; neither adds evidence, and no row of the matrix moved to make either true. Row 4 now states the explicit disposition standard in the row itself and says in the same breath that this is not section 13.5's answered-bar, which is false and honestly so. Row 12 now states operation-vocabulary closure with its three architectural grounds and records that nothing was ever submitted and nothing ever refused. The exit assessment is re-recorded against both.

**The corrected arithmetic**, recomputed at the wave's base rather than taken from the review: the 108-row matrix is 82 ANSWERED (34 first-party discharged, 24 native-run observed, 17 native-refusal observed, 1 determinism, 1 paired relation, 3 first-party fact, 2 report-layer) + 1 VOCABULARY-CLOSED, which `is_answered` reports false for and which section 4.2 puts outside the coverage denominator, + 25 STILL REQUIRED. The review computed 80 + 1 + 27 at the reviewed tip; the difference is the handoff arc, which minted the paired-relation standing and answered the key-path row. The claim the review refuted — "eighty-one observed or first-party-established" — was wrong on both sides of the ruling: it counted a vocabulary-closed row as established, and it is superseded by a recomputation rather than repeated with a new total.

**`R5-003`** was the review's sharpest finding and the repair only ADDS binding. The lane accepted any observed layer for the bare-u mutant and the control, checked the control's readback only where a reverification happened to be present, and checked the consensus and leaf mutants without reference to the recorded detail, the accepted identity, or the recorded separators — so it would have stayed green with a REJECTED control, which makes every refusal in the run unattributable. Each verdict the ceremony's `run_of_record` constants carry is now asserted against them, with row-set equality both ways. No constant moved and no existing assertion weakened. The reason the lane had left them unasserted — that a lane asserting a verdict fails rather than reports when the honest answer changes — is answered by the order of operations: the transcript is written to disk before the first assertion runs.

**`R5-004`** is the honest half of a typed stop. The in-repo covenant establishes that the two partners' arrangements carry a SECOND failing input and therefore have no separating fact of their own against the partner already driven; it does not establish which of the two failures a target reports for a multi-input candidate, and the register said it did. The prediction is withdrawn and the typing is unchanged. CORRECTED by the binding-closeout wave, whose re-review found this sentence's count too strong: the `T5-071` repair reached FOUR sites and this record said those four were all that carried it. TWO more did — `LeafArrangement::typed_partner` in the owner-signing ceremony and the paired-leaf evidence test's own comment, each still saying an unbuilt mutant would draw the SAME verdict at the SAME clause. Six sites carried it; four were repaired then and the remaining two are repaired here, all six now resting on the non-separation the covenant does establish. The finding stands as filed and the withdrawal is complete; only the count is corrected.

**`R5-009` is the orchestrator's own finding against its own records**, filed here rather than left in a report. The exit-time record asserted both plans validators clean at the reviewed tip; validator 2 was RED there, refusing the duplicate mint `R5-008` names. Two independent reproductions stand: `T5-069` reproduced it byte-identically at that tip, and a direct server run of the validator against the reviewed tip reproduced it again. The lesson is filed with the finding — a validator reported green without a run to point at is a claim, and the exit record made one.

### Guide-11 execution wave records (archived)

The three Guide-11 execution wave records — CT fixtures and the
conservation matrix, candidate dispositions and normalization, and the
fresh-process lifecycle — are archived verbatim, with their numbering
and their labels, in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md);
a reference to any of their task labels resolves there. All three
closed DONE at the Guide-11 gate (section 2.4).

### T6 — Validate capabilities for external-evidence obligations · `task:review:external-evidence-capability`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE

Reproduction: with every capability available except whole-transaction value
conservation, production planning returned feasible plans for both pilots
(two compact-ASH and four live-transfer candidates) that carried the
substrate-conservation evidence requirement while omitting the conservation
capability entirely.

Repair: the external-evidence obligation class now retains its approved proof
alternative, required capabilities, and source requirements. Classification
validates that the realization approves exactly one substrate-conservation
alternative, with a typed error for any other shape. Enumeration tests the
fixed capability set against the capability view before the search begins and
seeds every candidate from the fixed requirements. The evidence requirement
remains unresolved, and no sponsor amount enters any fixed requirement.

Focused tests, in the compiler proof suite:

- `a_missing_whole_transaction_capability_blocks_substrate_conservation`
- `adding_the_whole_transaction_capability_restores_feasibility`
- `external_evidence_carries_its_capability_and_source_into_every_candidate`
- `fixed_external_requirements_name_no_sponsor_amount`
- `an_unexpected_external_evidence_alternative_is_rejected`

### T7 — Constrain every representation-sensitive proof choice · `task:review:representation-proof-compatibility`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE

Reproduction: unconstrained live-transfer planning returned four candidates,
two of which paired a selected mode with a contradictory arithmetic proof on
the representation relation itself (private committed with public arithmetic,
and explicit with confidential conservation).

Repair: representation relations are declared relation-only in both pilot
declarations, with the approved mode sets unchanged, and the compiler
classifies them as statically validated alongside lifecycle exits. The
conservation relation keeps exact proof/mode compatibility. Live transfer now
yields exactly one candidate per approved mode, and the selected mode remains
in each candidate's representations for later placement and backend work.

Focused tests, in the compiler proof suite:

- `representation_relations_carry_no_proof_variable`
- `live_transfer_conservation_agrees_with_every_selected_mode`
- `compact_ash_keeps_both_modes_under_public_arithmetic`
- `every_pilot_relation_is_classified_exactly_once`, extended

The independent oracle no longer calls production obligation classification.
It derives the substrate-conservation capability and its typed external
source row itself, creates no proof variable for representation relations,
and validates fixed requirements before enumeration. New oracle regressions
cover the missing whole-transaction capability across all scopes, one
candidate per live mode, and random capability views over all thirteen
capabilities, while still distinguishing infeasibility from unexpected
errors.

### T8 — Weld every current-phase declaration · `task:review:phase-declaration-drift`

**Priority:** P2
**Status:** DONE

Repair: the plans README declares Phase 2 in the fixed declaration form. The
plan checker now compares the backlog current gate, the roadmap current
phase, the plans README current phase, and exactly one active numbered phase
card, normalized to the numeric phase. Diagnostics are order-stable and name
the stale file, the observed phase, and the expected phase; malformed or
missing declarations fail explicitly.

Focused tests: ten phase-weld tests in the labels plans module covering
agreement, each stale copy, zero and two active cards, malformed and missing
declarations, a gate without a phase card, and traversal-order independence.

### T9 — Refresh compiler status documentation · `task:review:compiler-status-drift`

**Priority:** P2
**Status:** DONE

Repair: the compiler crate Rustdoc lists the implemented internal stages and
the remaining absent work, and keeps the boundary statement that no public
value can be mistaken for a completed analysis. The compiler package
contract and the packages index carry an accurate status and milestone
states, and the phase card separates delivered-analysis requirements from
the open placement, coverage, and pilot deliverables. The stale-phrase sweep
found two current-state matches; both were corrected.

Verification: compiler package tests, a warning-free Rustdoc build, and the
plans check all passed.

### 6.2 Completed foundation

The following are implemented internally and remain subject to their package
tests and owner validation:

```text
P2-001  realization boundary
P2-002  Petgraph review
P2-003  compiler crate and error root
P2-004  compiler input binding
P2-005  relation/expression DAGs
P2-006  checked constant folding
P2-007  exact proof planning, reaccepted
P2-008  source, constructibility, and disclosure analysis
P2-009  representation lifecycle
P2-010  execution-case placement and layout requirements
P2-011  relation-indexed coverage requirements
```

No complete analyzed-program public API is exposed yet. This is deliberate:
partial analyses must not be mistaken for a completed compiler result.

### P2-007 — Repair and reaccept exact proof planning · `task:phase2:proof-planning`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** T6, T7, P2-005, P2-006
**Blocks:** P2-010 through P2-013

Reaccepted after T6 and T7 closed; the gate record is in §2.8.

Reacceptance required, and the recorded evidence establishes:

1. every in-scope relation classified exactly once;
2. every approved proof alternative retained or rejected for a typed reason;
3. external-evidence capabilities validated;
4. proof/representation compatibility applied completely;
5. capability and source requirements consistent;
6. hard constraints applied before objective or candidate retention;
7. exact feasible set compared with an independently derived exhaustive oracle;
8. no partial result on complexity exhaustion;
9. deterministic candidate ordering and equality under declaration
   permutations.

The search retains the exact feasible set; it does not silently select one
candidate under an unstated target policy.

### P2-010 — Derive execution-case placement and layout requirements · `task:phase2:placement`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** accepted P2-007, P2-008, P2-009, C1-009
**Blocks:** P2-011 and P2-012

Delivered in the Guide-5 batch; the gate record and evidence are in §2.9.

Relations are classified per execution case on independent axes — discharge
boundary, semantic scope, activation, and carrier multiplicity — rather than
one local/global/conditional/duplicated category. Execution cases expand only
the sponsor dimension; the representation is fixed by each feasible proof
plan. Every active runtime relation case has an eligible abstract carrier;
carrier eligibility, exact feasible placement sets, and target-independent
layout requirements are validated against an independent exhaustive oracle.
Complexity limits are explicit typed parameters and exhaustion returns no
partial result. No target bytes or concrete target positions enter this
stage.

### P2-011 — Derive relation-indexed coverage requirements · `task:phase2:coverage`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** P2-010, C1-010, C1-013
**Blocks:** P2-012

Delivered in the Guide-6 batch; the gate record and evidence are in §2.10.

Exact equality holds among the realization relation scope, the compiler
relation scope, the relation-case plan scope, and the coverage scope. Every
active relation-case carries positive and negative requirements at each of
its boundaries, a carrier requirement when runtime-carried, and an accepted
semantic-projection requirement; inactive relation-cases carry an explicit
inactive-valid requirement; conditional relations satisfy the
inactive-valid, active-valid, active-invalid triplet across the case set,
and representation modes are covered across the complete feasible plan
set. A broad operation test does not substitute for relation coverage.

### P2-012 — Analyze both pilots end to end · `task:phase2:pilots`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** T6, T7, P2-005 through P2-011
**Blocks:** P2-013

Delivered in the Guide-7 batch; the gate record and evidence are in §2.11.

Both pilots analyze end to end into one validated scoped analyzed program
per scope: the acceptance relation lists are the exact relation censuses,
every requirement in the acceptance matrices holds, rejected proof and
representation pairings are absent from the plan set, repeated analysis
from equal typed inputs produces equal stable projections, and the
combined two-pilot scope stores per-operation factors whose product
equals the retired global enumeration exactly. The analyzed value claims
no deployment lifecycle completeness: the pilots retain their future
target and operation obligations explicitly.

### P2-013 — Phase-2 evidence and exit · `gate:backlog:phase2`

**Priority:** Gate
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** T6–T9, P2-004 through P2-012, C1-005, C1-008,
C1-009, C1-010, C1-013

Passed; the complete exit evidence is the Guide-7 gate record in §2.11,
including the declared-MSRV and current-stable lanes, the meson-required
CI run, the explicit product regressions, and passed document byte
reproducibility. Every exit condition held: findings closed, censuses
exact, capabilities failing closed, deterministic pilot analysis,
independent oracles agreeing, gates recorded, current-phase declarations
moving together, and a clean final tree.

Phase completion does not itself justify a persistent compiler digest;
none was minted.

### 7.2 C1-008 — Proof-plan search reacceptance

Reaccepted in the Guide-4 batch, gate record §2.8. The recorded evidence
establishes each former condition:

- external-evidence capability requirements are retained;
- representation-sensitive proofs are checked against selected modes;
- candidate capabilities and sources agree;
- the independent oracle derives those rules independently;
- infeasibility and complexity exhaustion remain distinct;
- no partial result is returned.

### 7.3 C1-009 — Execution-case-aware placement

Delivered in the Guide-5 batch with P2-010; the gate record is in §2.9.
Every active relation case is covered by an eligible carrier, production
search is compared with an independent exhaustive assignment oracle on
small instances and both pilot scopes, and the adversarial case list —
optional-carrier defects, global-on-local defects, source unavailability,
duplicate enforcement, permutation equality, and both budget exhaustions —
is retained as focused regressions.

### 7.4 C1-010 — Typed symbols and SCC policy

Delivered in the Guide-6 batch within the coverage scope; the gate record is
in §2.10. Two-pass typed resolution runs a complete definition census before
complete reference resolution; duplicate keys, unknown references, and
cross-operation references fail; SCC members and diagnostics are normalized
by stable key and every current cycle is rejected. SCC membership does not
authorize a semantic cycle — an accepted cycle would require a new typed
resolution strategy and policy review. This work prepares linker policy but
pulled no linker or target types into compiler core.

### 7.5 C1-013 — Independent algorithm oracles

| Production analysis | Independent oracle |
|---|---|
| canonical topology | valid-order enumeration plus least-key rule |
| SCC | mutual-reachability equivalence |
| expression interning | non-interned evaluator |
| dependency closure | repeated complete scan |
| proof selection | exhaustive candidate enumeration with independently derived hard constraints |
| placement | exhaustive carrier subsets |
| relation census | direct set equality |
| constant folding | non-folded evaluator |
| stable projection | declaration-order permutation |
| coverage | direct relation × case matrix equality |

The proof-selection oracle must not call the same obligation-classification or
compatibility helper as production for the property it is meant to verify.

Delivered across the Guide-5 and Guide-6 batches: the placement oracle in
§2.9; the relation-by-case coverage oracle, the repeated-scan collateral
oracle, and the mutual-reachability SCC oracle in §2.10. Each restates its
hard predicates independently of the production helper it verifies.

## 8. Dependency posture · `sec:backlog:dependencies`

### 8.1 Current and deferred dependencies · `tab:backlog:dependencies`

| Dependency | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `petgraph = 0.8.3` | Adopted and reviewed; `serde-1` only | Graph storage and standard algorithms |
| `num-bigint` | Existing | Exact arbitrary-size integers |
| `num-integer` | Existing | Exact integer helpers |
| `num-traits` | Existing | Numeric traits |
| `proptest` | Existing | Property and independent-oracle testing |
| `sha2` | Existing | tagged SHA-256 for taproot leaf, branch and tweak commitments |
| `num-rational` | Deferred | Future exact-rational consumer |
| `faer` | Deferred | Future certified numerical diagnostics |
| `fixedbitset` | Deferred | Dense local coverage sets if measured |
| Elements libraries | Phase-3 review | Target transaction and consensus types |
| SAT/LP/MILP solver | Deferred | Larger exact planning only after measured need |
| `salsa` | Deferred | Incremental compiler queries |
| `egg` | Deferred | Equality saturation |
| `rayon` | Removed and deferred | Requires measured need and schedule-independent results |

The latest static review excluded `Cargo.lock`; no lockfile claim is made by
that review.

### 8.2 Dependency-entry rule · `rule:backlog:dependency-entry`

A deferred dependency enters only when:

1. a concrete consumer exists;
2. current implementation demonstrates missing functionality;
3. simpler exact first-party code is insufficient;
4. source, version, licence, MSRV, unsafe boundary, transitive graph,
   determinism, and advisories are reviewed;
5. public API leakage is considered;
6. focused tests and an independent oracle exist;
7. lockfile changes are reviewed;
8. required gates remain green and clean.

Unused dependencies are not added to advertise intent.

---

## 9. Mathematical and algorithmic laws · `sec:backlog:laws`

### 9.1 Exactness · `rule:backlog:exactness`

Semantic, conservation, authorization, identity, calibration, and release
claims use:

- checked bounded integers;
- arbitrary-precision integers;
- reduced exact rationals;
- exact finite search;
- independently checked certificates;
- target-native execution where the claim concerns the target.

A floating residual is diagnostic evidence, not exact equality.

### 9.2 Handles and identity · `rule:backlog:handles`

Always distinguish:

```text
local handle:
    process-local graph, arena, matrix, or solver position

stable key:
    complete typed semantic identity

digest:
    optional domain-separated commitment, admitted per the
    identity adjudication procedure
```

Never use as semantic identity:

- Petgraph indices;
- matrix positions;
- solver variable numbers;
- insertion or traversal order;
- source path or line;
- pivot order;
- floating-point bits;
- thread schedule;
- temporary path.

### 9.3 Complexity failure · `rule:backlog:complexity`

An analysis exceeding its explicit budget returns a typed complexity error.

It must not:

- drop a relation;
- weaken authorization;
- increase disclosure silently;
- remove a lifecycle exit;
- switch to an undocumented greedy fallback;
- claim optimality from incomplete search;
- accept the best partial result seen before exhaustion.

### 9.4 Evidence separation · `rule:backlog:evidence-separation`

Keep separate:

- typed validation;
- capability availability;
- witness/source availability;
- model execution;
- realization conformance;
- compiler completeness;
- backend pattern evidence;
- linked-bundle execution;
- target consensus/policy results;
- event projection;
- attestation query;
- receipt accounting;
- calibration;
- release validation.

A report or status from one class never silently satisfies another.

In particular:

```text
target capability exists
≠
required evidence was produced

sponsor role structure is valid
≠
substrate conservation was evidenced

model relation is conformant
≠
deployment is ready
```

## 10. Verification matrix · `sec:backlog:verification`

### 10.1 Working cadence

For Rust changes:

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

Do not run the full Meson/release surface after every small edit.

Documentation-only changes do not require the Rust lane, but they still require
the relevant documentation and census checks.

### 10.2 Focused commands · `tab:backlog:focused-tests`

| Area | Command |
|---|---|
| architecture/profile | `cargo test -p tripod-architecture` |
| realization | `cargo test -p tripod-realization` |
| compiler | `cargo test -p tripod-compiler` |
| compiler planning | `cargo test -p tripod-compiler proof` |
| compiler oracle | `cargo test -p tripod-compiler oracle` |
| model conformance | `cargo test -p tripod-model realization_conformance` |
| model bounds | `cargo test -p tripod-model bound_conformance` |
| artifacts | `cargo test -p tripod-artifacts` |
| labels/plans | `cargo test -p tripod-labels` |
| checker report/stamps | `cargo test -p cli-common` |
| document stamps | `cargo test -p tripod-document-stamps` |
| flattener | `cargo test -p flatten-latex-main` |
| process wrapper | `cargo test -p execwrap` |
| mocked Meson graph | `meson test -C build meson-mock-contract` |
| executor classification | `meson test -C build executor-classification` |

Focused filters supplement but never replace complete package and workspace
runs. Every gate lane is a Meson test (CI-009), so any of them narrows the
same way: `scripts/ci.sh --suite lint`, or a lane by name.

### 10.3 Full gate

After a completed batch:

```sh
scripts/ci.sh
meson compile -C build
meson test -C build --print-errorlogs
```

The first line is the whole lane surface with the TeX toolchain mocked; the
second and third add the real document build, which the mocked run cannot
cover. `scripts/ci.sh` is a shim over `meson test` and forwards its arguments,
and `scripts/ci-timing-report.py` reads the finished run's logs for the
per-suite, per-lane, and per-test timing.

The canonical build directory is `build/`.

Use:

```sh
meson setup build
```

only if `build/` does not exist.

For a complete release-oriented result, additionally run the required MSRV and
stable lanes and the separate byte-reproducibility check:

```sh
scripts/check-document-reproducibility.sh
```

### 10.4 Documentation and census

```sh
scripts/check-plans.sh
meson compile -C build lint
git diff --check
git diff --cached --check
```

Every new tracked subject must join its nearest `meson.build` census.

### 10.5 Dependency and advisory evidence

```sh
cargo tree -e features
cargo metadata
cargo audit
```

A missing `cargo-audit` is recorded as skipped, never passed.

### 10.6 Clean repository

The final check is:

```sh
git status --porcelain=v1 --untracked-files=all
```

It must be empty.

### 10.7 Execution trust

Repository source, tests, Cargo manifests, Meson definitions, scripts, TeX,
and `.latexmkrc` are executable.

Untrusted contributions run only in an externally established,
credential-free isolated environment under ADR-015. A clean-tree result is a
correctness check, not malicious-code containment.

## 11. Current gate · `gate:backlog:current`

The Phase-2 gate is **passed** (§2.11), the Phase-3 gate is
**passed** (§2.6 with the Phase-3 card), and the Phase-4 gate is
**passed** (§2.8). The Guide-13 batch gate is §2.9: at that historical
gate Phase 5 had not exited, because the batch stopped honestly on the two
typed blockers the intermediate confidential-funding guide owned; the
live-transfer campaign subsequently closed and Phase 5 exited in §2.20 and
§2.21 with the amended gate met on a countersigned assessment, and Phase 6
is current.

The Guide-8 target foundation is complete; the gate record is §2.12.

The T3, T4, and T5 closed rows are archived verbatim in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md#exited-phase-task-rows) under the Exited-phase task rows group, so a textual reference to any of those row ids resolves there. The open Phase-4 row remains here:

| ID | Status | Task |
|---|---|---|
| `T4-009` | TODO | Negative relation coverage (Waves 13–13e): the mutation machinery, the derived class-to-requirement link, per-mutation funding, three section-18 boundary respecs proven against live evidence, and one negative row discharged. Open honestly: 71 of 72 negative rows outstanding, each naming its reason in code; the remedy is the three guide gaps, filed as [the Guide-13 feature requests](guides/guide_thirteen_feature_requests.md), not more first-party tests. Full narrative archived in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md) |

The Phase-6 task state opens with the Guide-14 document import; each wave
lands with its own evidence:

The T6 through T11 closed rows are archived verbatim in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md#phase-6-closed-task-rows) under the Phase-6 closed task rows group, so a textual reference to any of those row ids resolves there.

| ID | Status | Task |
|---|---|---|




Current blockers are: NONE carried by the live evidence set, whose residual set is now EMPTY. `PredecessorConstructorAbsent` was the last member and it left by a RULING rather than by a run: the observed pair its clearing rule demanded was demanded by a mis-typing of the `time-locked-input` row, §10.4 refuses the maturity half because the time-locked class is a receipt class rather than a consensus timelock, and the refusal half attributes to a leaf the spent program does not commit to, which every foreign taptree draws alike — so no observation of it could ever name the lock. The row is retyped FIRST-PARTY beside its `time-locked-output` sibling and discharged against the constructor typing that is the real protection. An empty residual set is not a smaller set of obligations: the rows a run has still to answer are counted by the census and not by it, and no time-locked spend was ever observed refused. `SponsorEnvelopeSignerAbsent` is CLEARED, by its own defining site's rule and on an observed result rather than on a capability existing: a sponsor-signed explicit control was accepted by a real node, read back from the node's own copy byte for byte, and mined, which is the acceptance that rule said a returned byte stack had to wait for. The sighash blockers are cleared, the confidential predecessor is funded, the signing handoff is closed, and the evidence restart has taken its first five steps against a real node — six positive private matrix rows are answered by observed acceptances of their own shapes, the three proof-negatives are observed at the mempool boundary and attributed by field, and the multi-output and multi-input fixture constructor exists and derives at any width. The restart order stopped typed at step six on the sponsor signer dependency through three waves; that dependency closed by observation, and the minimality wave recorded step six and step seven in a wave-eight ledger of its own — the wave-seven ledger is a record and was not amended. The order is COMPLETE: all seven steps accepted, the disposition is `Completed`, and both accepted steps state their own shortfalls in their entries. Eight positive private rows have moved on observed acceptances of their own shapes, private-merge and private-sponsor-values being the two the minimality wave added — the sponsor row had moved in the guide closeout while the safety matrix still classified it as awaiting a run, and the matrix caught up in the same wave rather than being left to disagree with the closeout. Of the remaining two, deterministic-public-fixture-openings is now ANSWERED in the safety matrix on a minted determinism standing — its §11.2 gate is the byte-identity contract rather than an acceptance, the wave-7 observation was already recorded, and the new member is counted in its own bucket so a determinism observation is never read as an acceptance; it stays out of the closeout delta, which admits target-computed identities only, and the two artifacts disagreeing there is the vocabulary difference showing rather than a row nobody is checking. Projection-equality-with-paired-explicit did NOT move and the failing conjunct is named: its rule wants an observed acceptance of its own shape, and no run compares the semantic projections of an accepted private transaction and its paired accepted explicit one — the equality this workspace holds is first-party, over registry members that never reached a target. The remaining work is an observation comparing two accepted transactions' projections, and runs of the two pair shapes that have none; one question is still handed up for a ruling, the deterministic-fixture-openings gate, and the step-six/step-seven ordering question is answered by the erratum filed against the guide's mandatory chain. The sponsor dependency is CLOSED and its closure was a repair to this repository rather than to the target: the deployment's fee-role program digest was a fixture constant no program hashes to, threading it to the digest the target itself computes for the empty fee program construction writes produced the first observed sponsor-signed acceptance, and the record says in its own bytes that this establishes the sponsor envelope's wire and one acceptance and not production multi-party sponsor signing.
