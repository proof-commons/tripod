# Tripod Implementation Backlog

> **Status:** ACTIVE
> **Current gate:** Phase 5 — Live receipt transfer
> **Current condition:** Phases 1 and 2 are complete. The target-independent compiler constructs one deterministic, validated scoped analyzed program for the complete pilot scope, factorized per operation, with relation-owned requirements, a corruption-resistant assembly validator, and independent assembly oracles; the Phase-2 exit gate record is in §2.11, including passed document reproducibility. Phase 3 then delivered the Guide-8 target foundation, the Guide-9 native primitive gate, the Guide-10 constructor and wide-floor prototypes, and the Guide-11 declassification result, each with its own gate record. Public declassification is no longer an open blocker: an initial policy is selected — an explicit boundary reached by owner-authorized normalization, with the direct and public-committed paths deferred against three named target blockers — and the gate record is in §2.4. Phase-3 exit is recorded: the Guide-12 preflight register closed all sixteen seventh-review rows, and (`gate:phase3:exit`) was checked green on that tree with the record in §2.6. Phase-4 exit is recorded in §2.8: compact ASH ran end to end against a live target with twelve accepted and matched submissions and honest coverage stated at 100 of 211. The current work is Phase 5 — Guide 13's owner-authorized live receipt transfer — which consumes the Phase-4 pipeline rather than redesigning it and begins implementation only when the Guide-13 preflight register closes.
> **Next gate:** Phase 5 — live-transfer end-to-end pipeline
> **Authority:** Current execution queue only. The specification, the realization document, typed architecture, implemented ADRs, accepted decisions, package contracts, phase cards, and accepted research results take precedence.

This file contains only:

- the current repository and readiness state;
- the latest static-review basis and open findings;
- compact historical milestones and gate records;
- the active Phase-2 compiler queue;
- immediate algorithm preparation;
- dependency posture;
- verification and clean-tree requirements.

Detailed historical implementation narratives belong to Git history, annotated
tags, phase cards, ADRs, accepted decisions, and focused evidence records—not
to the active backlog.

## 1. Backlog contract · `sec:backlog:contract`

### 1.1 Authority · `rule:backlog:authority`

This backlog sequences work. It is not protocol, realization, compiler, target,
ABI, evidence, deployment, or release input.

When artifacts disagree:

| Subject | Owner |
|---|---|
| abstract economic interface | the Attestation specification |
| realization meaning, invariants, obligations, and residuals | the realization document |
| finite registries and stable architecture IDs | typed architecture |
| current executable reference behavior | executable model |
| repository engineering policy | implemented ADRs |
| accepted cross-package implementation direction | planning decisions |
| package boundary | package contract |
| phase entry, deliverables, and exit | phase card |
| unresolved design question | research note |
| current task ordering | this backlog |

A lower owner never overrides an upper owner on the upper owner’s subject.

### 1.2 Status vocabulary · `tab:backlog:status`

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **TODO** | Ready when its named dependencies are complete. |
| **IN PROGRESS** | Actively being implemented, reviewed, or verified. |
| **BLOCKED** | A named dependency or correctness defect prevents safe progress. |
| **PARKED** | Deliberately inactive until a concrete consumer or measured need exists. |
| **DONE** | Implementation, focused evidence, required gates, documentation, and clean-tree evidence are recorded. |
| **DROPPED** | Deliberately not implemented; rationale and replacement are recorded. |
| **HISTORICAL** | Immutable evidence about an earlier revision; not a claim about the current checkout. |

Code resembling an intended result is not sufficient for `DONE`.

A static-review finding remains open until one of these occurs:

1. the finding is reproduced and fixed with focused coverage;
2. a typed proof shows the reported state is unconstructible;
3. reproduction shows the finding is false;
4. the owning policy or assurance claim is deliberately corrected.

“Existing tests pass” does not close a finding unless a named test reaches the
reported path.

### 1.3 Priority vocabulary · `tab:backlog:priority`

| Priority | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **P0** | Can manufacture false release, deployment, provenance, or semantic evidence. |
| **P1** | Trusted semantic/evidence boundary defect or active phase blocker. |
| **P2** | Required correctness, determinism, publication, identity, or documentation work before phase exit. |
| **P3** | Maintainability or evidence-quality work required by the active gate. |
| **POST** | Later-phase work that does not block the current gate. |

### 1.4 Definition of done · `rule:backlog:done`

An implementation task is `DONE` only when it records:

1. implementing source files;
2. focused positive and negative tests;
3. affected ADRs, decisions, package contracts, phase cards, or research notes;
4. exact verification commands and outcomes;
5. generated-publication and label impact;
6. semantic, identity, schema, and migration impact;
7. dependency impact;
8. final clean-tree output.

A review finding additionally records whether reproduction confirmed,
refuted, or reclassified it.

A dependency task additionally records:

- selected source and exact version;
- enabled features;
- transitive graph;
- licence;
- MSRV;
- unsafe boundary;
- determinism and parallelism implications;
- advisory status;
- lockfile impact.

A research task additionally records:

- exact question and constraints;
- prototype and tool versions;
- accepted and rejected candidates;
- positive and negative evidence;
- measurements;
- permanent implementation handoff.

### 1.5 Identity admission · `rule:backlog:identity-admission`

No new digest or digest-bearing field enters merely because an object is
important.

A proposed identity must satisfy
(`req:identity:admission-record`) and name:

- the complete typed object or exact bytes;
- owner and producer;
- a present consumer;
- the exact decision the consumer makes;
- assurance class;
- canonical projection and encoding;
- domain separator and recipe identifier;
- stale conditions;
- migration behavior;
- explicit non-claims.

No named consumer means no digest. No distinct decision means no digest.

## 2. Review basis and current evidence · `sec:backlog:review-basis`

### 2.1 Latest static review · `tab:backlog:review-basis`

The current review is the sixth static review, performed in two independent
passes over the supplied concatenation of the tree:

```text
tree:
   

selected files:
    220
```

The supplied filter excluded 352 files, among them:

```text
Cargo.lock
the paper sources
most unit and integration tests
most compiler implementation files
most executable-model implementation files
the label-tool implementation
several build/tooling packages and scripts
```

No Cargo, Meson, TeX, the native executor, advisory, or reproducibility
command was run as part of this review.

Therefore:

- the review makes no current green-build claim;
- the excluded packages and test directories received no content review;
- lockfile checksums and resolved features were not independently verified;
- advisory status was not checked;
- licence compatibility was not independently checked;
- historical gate records remain historical evidence only.

Its findings are recorded in §5.6. Its central verdict is that the native
evidence layer still does not bind evidence to its subject: an execution
transcript retains neither the requested subjects nor the exact fixtures
sent to the child, so it can be rebound to a census, matrix, target, or
deployment that was never executed; and the claim a fixture files under is
caller-authored, so claim-bearing metadata can be attached to an unrelated
or trivially true script. Both passes rank those as release-blocking for
that subsystem, and no public-declassification prototype begins while they
remain open. The review text is archived at
[plans/reviews/review-6-0.3.4-dev.md](reviews/review-6-0.3.4-dev.md).

### 2.2 Earlier review basis

The repository retains seven earlier reviewed trees as historical context:

```text
initial reviewed tree:
   

follow-up reviewed tree:
   

proof-planning reviewed tree:
   

second-review tree:
   

third-review tree:
   

fourth-review tree:
   

fifth-review tree:
   
```

Those reviews and their findings are evidence about their exact trees. They are
not current-checkout execution evidence. The second through sixth review
texts are archived under [plans/reviews/](reviews/README.md).

### 2.3 Historical gate records

The completed gate records for Phase 1, the T1–T5 remediation, the P2-004
compiler-input batch, and Guides 2 through 10 stood here as §2.3–§2.14.
They are archived verbatim, with their original numbering and labels, in
[backlog history](history/backlog-history.md), so a reference to §2.8 or
§2.11 anywhere below resolves to the heading of that number there.

### 2.4 Guide-11 declassification gate (archived)

Closed and archived verbatim, with its label, in
[backlog history](history/backlog-history.md) beside the earlier
records; §2.4 references below resolve to the heading of that number
there.

### 2.5 Draft-promotion gate · `gate:backlog:draft-promotion`

The 2026-08-19 batch executed the user's promotion ruling: the
identity-adjudication and interchange drafts take priority as the
disciplines, ADR-016 is deleted rather than kept superseded, every
overlap is deleted rather than restated, and ADR-010 stays untouched as
a different scope. Wave 1 minted [ADR-021](../adr/021-identity-adjudication.md)
carrying only adoption data — the single local recipe convention, the
current-identities table, the separation migration verbatim, the
ADR-011 amendment linkage, and three recorded divergences — and
retargeted all ten imported citations of the retired owner; the
released realization contract took one prose sentence with a three-way
proof no identity moved. Wave 2 minted
[ADR-022](../adr/022-interchange-conventions.md) adopting the
fourth-edition interchange conventions wholesale, stated the ADR-010
boundary one-directionally, restated the executor wire-frame stop from
the identities register with its revisit condition intact, and
discharged DI-005 — the integration queue of §13 is closed. CI-005 was
recorded in the same batch under the user's wall-time ruling.

Gate, content-scoped per the cadence ruling and CI-005: the light lane
registry passed 9 lanes with the two test lanes skipped by design, 331
cumulative seconds inside the runner, 5 m 31 s wall; the corpus checker
oracle passed all four checkers in 5.6 s on the merged tree; the full
workspace suite ran green once, inside Wave 1, immediately after the
batch's only Rust-touching edits, and the delta since is markdown only.
No identity moved: the generated manifest is byte-identical and both
registers regenerate byte-identically. Weight: this record's room came
from archiving the closed Guide-11 gate record to history per the
CI-004 pattern, 9470 bytes net. Lane wall-times, recorded per the
wall-time ruling: Wave 1 two stints (interrupted by a harness restart,
resumed with work intact), final stint 9 m; Wave 2 two stints, final
stint 20 m 19 s; both workers' reports carry their own lane timings.
Found in passing and owed to CI-005: the golden-capture script prints
each checker's exit status but exits 0 itself, so a chained commit can
proceed past a red checker — it did once here, caught on the next run;
the archival also taught that a block moved into history must have its
relative links re-based, which the checker catches as broken links.

### 2.6 Guide-12 preflight and Phase-3 exit gate (archived)

### 2.7 Guide-12 build boundary (archived)

### 2.8 Guide-12 Phase-4 exit gate (archived)

The three Guide-12 gate records are archived verbatim, with their
labels, in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md) under the
Guide-12 records group; a reference to §2.6, §2.7, or §2.8 below
resolves to the heading of that number there. Phase 4 exited at §2.8:
twelve accepted and matched live submissions, honest coverage 100 of
211, the section-29 audit at 94 of 105, the local gate 47 of 47 with
byte-identical document reproduction, and the runtime half of
`G12-R04` discharged from the wave transcripts.

### The verification harness's two standing hazards · `rem:backlog:verification-harness`

A verdict is read from the report wrapper's own report line, never from a pipeline's shell status: the wrapper propagates its exit code faithfully, and a pipe to a filter truncates the status to the last stage's. And a single shared build-target directory is poisoned when checkouts of two different commits build the same crates into it, so a lane that moves between commits pins a target directory of its own.

### Publication metadata · `rem:backlog:publication-metadata`

The published documents carry their attribution and their terms: the attribution position names Proof Commons, a commons rather than a company, and the document set is dedicated to the public domain. A specification exists to be reproduced, cited and implemented, and an attribution condition taxes exactly that use, so the attribution that matters is the one the title page carries. The rights line states the dedication, the licence-URL field names the canonical deed for machine readers, and the document licence file holds the legal code verbatim.

### The crates carry the product's name · `rem:backlog:crate-naming`

Each crate manifest and the build system's project name the product, so the product the repository describes is the product its artifacts are named after. The name feeds nothing that hashes, exports or gates: the versioning derivation reads the version alone, the binary and library target names are their own, and the generated model artifacts never carried it.

### The realization's fixed body states its law · `rem:backlog:law-delimitation`

The realization's fixed body states the law without restating the era. The versioning law leaves its worked example to the masthead, which prints the live binding; the hash pins defer to the algorithm the attached envelope names; and the schema discriminants are read at their carriers — the envelope for the architecture manifest, the canonical query context for the wire, the bound profile for deployment. The workspace authors field names the publishing organization.

### The shared crate's acknowledgement · `rem:backlog:cli-common-thanks`

The shared command-line crate's README thanks the developers whose work inspired the tooling. Gratitude for inspiration, stated once, naming no repository and claiming no lineage: the crate's own manual remains the authority on what it does.

### The tip's tests assert their own consistency · `rem:backlog:tip-convergence`

The release profile's identity test derives its expected value from the profile itself rather than comparing against a hand-pinned constant, so the tree asserts its own internal consistency instead of a value a reader would have to take on trust. The paper is Attestation, the product is Tripod, and the protocol object is the attestation contract.

### The licence terms and their citation families · `rem:backlog:licence-convergence`

The code licence is stated once, in the licence file, and the manifest key, the toolchain licence rule and the dependency comments agree with it rather than restating it a second way. The dependency-review clauses name what a dropped feature pulled in and which rule refuses it, which holds under any workspace licence, and the toolchain record says why a copyleft workspace strengthens rather than relaxes the permissive-dependency rule. Documents stay under the public-domain dedication.

### The hash-citation audit the lint suite runs · `rem:backlog:hash-citation-audit`

The audit holds every published hexadecimal value to the identity rule, as a labels binary in the lint suite wired exactly as the forbidden-text check is: it asks git for the complete tracked set and requires every value to be described by a rule in the citation-families table, which names what each kind of value measures and the program that writes it. The audit places rather than recomputes — whether a digest is right belongs to the test that owns it — and what it establishes is that every value has an owner on the record.

### The cut the settled records carry · `rem:backlog:record-cut`

A planning record earns its place by what it establishes, so the passages that spent themselves on a document's own corrections are gone and what survives argues the result. A citation is a promise that a reader can fetch what it names, so the sites that cited tags no hub carries name the phase cards and the archived record as the durable record, with nothing hash-shaped substituted. The archive index states its rule for when a settled record may be edited at all, and states it there rather than here: a wave record that paraphrases a rule it does not own carries a second copy of it, and the copy stops being true the moment the rule is sharpened.

### The discipline every published value follows · `rem:backlog:hash-citation-discipline`

Every hexadecimal value the tree publishes declares how a reader establishes it: recomputable from bytes the tree carries under a named algorithm, resolvable to a referent a reader can fetch, or defined by something other than its author. A value that nothing regenerates, nothing resolves and nothing defines stands nowhere, including inside an encoded rendering, which a decode-and-assert check reads. The cascade above the captures recomputes from the bytes it is taken over, and each chosen constant is a derivation from a string published beside it.

### The separators spell the product's name · `rem:backlog:separator-convergence`

A domain separator is hashed input that identifies a recipe, and the product's name is part of that identity. Each separator spells it at the version it carries, because no projection, encoding or algorithm moved. The identities that follow those bytes are re-taken by the tree's own generator rather than edited, so the typed pin, the generated artifacts, the realization's envelope and the versioning gate carry one result.

### 3.2 Current published identities · `tab:backlog:identities`

Exact hash and version values are deliberately not duplicated here. Read each
identity from its authority:

| Identity | Authority |
|---|---|
| Specification version | `papers/attestation/main.tex` and `sections/00_title.tex` |
| Architecture schema, semantic/behavioural algorithms and hashes, anchor-set hash | `packages/model/generated/architecture.json`, checked against typed architecture |
| Realization version (tracked binding) | `docs/attestation/realization.md` masthead |
| Attestation wire schema | typed model/architecture constants |
| Deployment-profile schema | typed architecture constants |

The generated architecture publication is authoritative. Planning prose must
not become a competing identity source.

Architecture finality does not imply:

- complete realization scope;
- compiler completeness;
- target support;
- linked bundle or ABI existence;
- deployment evidence;
- production readiness.

### 3.3 Not implemented · `tab:backlog:not-implemented`

The identity freeze is lifted only under
(`req:identity:admission-record`). Phase 2 still mints
no public realization or compiler digest without a real consumer.

## 5. Current static-review findings · `sec:backlog:findings`

### 5.1 Summary · `tab:backlog:findings-current`

| ID | Priority | Status | Finding |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `T6` | P1 | DONE | External-evidence relations bypassed abstract capability validation during proof planning. |
| `T7` | P1 | DONE | Representation-relation proof choices were not constrained by the selected representation mode. |
| `T8` | P2 | DONE | Current-phase declarations disagreed and the plan checker did not detect all copies. |
| `T9` | P2 | DONE | Compiler status documentation materially understated implemented internal analysis. |

All four findings were reproduced or directly corrected, repaired, and
verified in the Guide-4 batch; the gate record is in §2.8. Their evidence
records follow. Implementation detail beyond these records belongs to Git
history. The later two-pass review recorded in §2.1 opened the SR2 findings
in §5.2.

### 5.2 Closed review registers

The finding registers of the second, third, fourth, and fifth static
reviews stood here as §5.2–§5.5. Every row was remediated and closed, in
the Guide-7, Guide-8, Guide-9, and Guide-10 preflight waves
respectively. They are archived verbatim, with their original numbering
and labels, in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md), so a
reference to §5.3 below resolves to the heading of that number there.


### 5.6 Sixth-review findings

The sixth static review’s finding register stood here. Every row was
remediated and closed in the Guide-11 preflight and declassification
waves. It is archived verbatim, with its original numbering and its
label, in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md), so a reference
to §5.6 below resolves to the heading of that number there.


### 5.7 Confidential-value target review · `tab:backlog:findings-ct-review`

The Guide-11 §5 target review read the confidential-value machinery at
merged tip `78499c2`, upstream base `b7fc5d0`, and landed its accepted
facts as typed Rust in `packages/target-elements/src/confidential.rs`
with human provenance in (`tab:elements-ref:review-ct`). The twenty
questions the guide sets are all answered from source.

The review's own numbering note: the preflight arc in §5.6 already
spends the label "Wave 5" on the row that closed `G11-H01`. This record
belongs to the guide's §5 execution, a different arc, and is filed by
content rather than by wave number.

Three dispositions come out of it, and one is a negative result that the
guide asks not to be softened.

| ID | Priority | Status | Finding |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `G11-C01` | P1 | DONE | The confidential encodings record whether the y coordinate is a quadratic residue, while the curve-checking primitives accept only the compressed public-key prefixes, which record whether y is odd. The two conventions select different points, so no pattern may be carried from one to the other by analogy. Typed as `PointParityConvention`. |
| `G11-C02` | P1 | DONE | The commitment relation is the conceptual one with both terms positive: the blinder multiplies the base point and the amount multiplies the asset generator. The opening scalar is thirty-two bytes big-endian, refused at or above the group order, admitted at zero. Typed as `CommitmentRelation`. |
| `G11-C03` | P0 | OPEN | An authenticated public opening has no complete on-script form under the reviewed revision. Three independent blockers are named and typed as `OpeningBlocker`; the capability stays `Unsupported` for that reason. This is the §11 disposition input and it is a review result, not a scope decision. |

`G11-C03` is the row every later declassification candidate must be
judged against. The blockers are that the asset generator cannot be
derived on-script, that the confidential and curve-primitive encoding
domains do not meet, and that a witness-supplied parity byte is bound to
nothing, so a relation a program could verify holds for a point or its
negation. Candidate C in the guide names parity as load-bearing; this
review supplies the source reason.

Two questions are recorded as OPTIONAL follow-ups rather than as
findings, because neither changes a typed fact.

| ID | Priority | Status | Item |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `G11-C04` | OPTIONAL | OPEN | The capability contract calls commitment equality `Unsupported`, which is exact for a primitive: no reviewed instruction compares two commitments. Byte equality over the exposed canonical items is nonetheless a composition a backend might build, and the guide's disposition vocabulary has a name for that state which the typed enum does not carry. Deciding whether `ConfidentialCapabilityState` should gain the backend-pattern and named-blocker states belongs to a wave that owns the contract shape, since the states are part of the versioned schema. |
| `G11-C05` | OPTIONAL | OPEN | Value introspection presents an absent value as an explicit zero, prefix `0x01` over eight zero bytes, so a program cannot distinguish an absent field from a zero one at that primitive. No current pattern depends on the difference. Recorded so that one which does is not written in the belief that the distinction survives. |

The typed facts are deliberately not wired into `TargetDefinition`.
Growing that schema is a versioned change under
(`rule:guide11-exec:target-version-honesty`), and this review states
facts rather than revising a contract shape; the contract version did
not move.

### 5.8 Dependency decision and commitment oracle (archived)

The Guide-11 dependency decision and the independent commitment
oracle record are archived verbatim, with their labels, in [backlog
history](history/backlog-history.md); references resolve there. The
decision to add nothing was later revised by the user's 2026-08-20
ruling recorded in section 2.7, which adopted the reference crates
as testing oracles.

### 5.9 Seventh-review preflight findings

The seventh static review’s preflight register stood here. Its sixteen
rows are the Guide-12 preflight identifiers `G12-R01` through
`G12-R16`; fifteen are CONFIRMED and DONE and `G12-R08` is
RECLASSIFIED and DONE, so the blocking rule
(`gate:guide12-exec:preflight`) is satisfied and no confirmed P0 or P1
row remains open. Wave 0 adjudicated and reproduced, and Waves 1a, 1b,
and 2 repaired: each row’s witness was written to assert its defect and
was flipped by the wave that fixed it. The register is archived
verbatim, with its numbering and its label, in [backlog
history](history/backlog-history.md), so a reference to §5.9 or to its
label resolves there. Guide-12 preflight dispositions themselves are
owned by the guide’s own table.

### Guide-11 execution wave records (archived)

The three Guide-11 execution wave records — CT fixtures and the
conservation matrix, candidate dispositions and normalization, and the
fresh-process lifecycle — are archived verbatim, with their numbering
and their labels, in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md);
a reference to any of their task labels resolves there. All three
closed DONE at the Guide-11 gate (section 2.4).

### T6 — Validate capabilities for external-evidence obligations · `task:review:external-evidence-capability`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE

Reproduction: with every capability available except whole-transaction value
conservation, production planning returned feasible plans for both pilots
(two compact-ASH and four live-transfer candidates) that carried the
substrate-conservation evidence requirement while omitting the conservation
capability entirely.

Repair: the external-evidence obligation class now retains its approved proof
alternative, required capabilities, and source requirements. Classification
validates that the realization approves exactly one substrate-conservation
alternative, with a typed error for any other shape. Enumeration tests the
fixed capability set against the capability view before the search begins and
seeds every candidate from the fixed requirements. The evidence requirement
remains unresolved, and no sponsor amount enters any fixed requirement.

Focused tests, in the compiler proof suite:

- `a_missing_whole_transaction_capability_blocks_substrate_conservation`
- `adding_the_whole_transaction_capability_restores_feasibility`
- `external_evidence_carries_its_capability_and_source_into_every_candidate`
- `fixed_external_requirements_name_no_sponsor_amount`
- `an_unexpected_external_evidence_alternative_is_rejected`

### T7 — Constrain every representation-sensitive proof choice · `task:review:representation-proof-compatibility`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE

Reproduction: unconstrained live-transfer planning returned four candidates,
two of which paired a selected mode with a contradictory arithmetic proof on
the representation relation itself (private committed with public arithmetic,
and explicit with confidential conservation).

Repair: representation relations are declared relation-only in both pilot
declarations, with the approved mode sets unchanged, and the compiler
classifies them as statically validated alongside lifecycle exits. The
conservation relation keeps exact proof/mode compatibility. Live transfer now
yields exactly one candidate per approved mode, and the selected mode remains
in each candidate's representations for later placement and backend work.

Focused tests, in the compiler proof suite:

- `representation_relations_carry_no_proof_variable`
- `live_transfer_conservation_agrees_with_every_selected_mode`
- `compact_ash_keeps_both_modes_under_public_arithmetic`
- `every_pilot_relation_is_classified_exactly_once`, extended

The independent oracle no longer calls production obligation classification.
It derives the substrate-conservation capability and its typed external
source row itself, creates no proof variable for representation relations,
and validates fixed requirements before enumeration. New oracle regressions
cover the missing whole-transaction capability across all scopes, one
candidate per live mode, and random capability views over all thirteen
capabilities, while still distinguishing infeasibility from unexpected
errors.

### T8 — Weld every current-phase declaration · `task:review:phase-declaration-drift`

**Priority:** P2
**Status:** DONE

Repair: the plans README declares Phase 2 in the fixed declaration form. The
plan checker now compares the backlog current gate, the roadmap current
phase, the plans README current phase, and exactly one active numbered phase
card, normalized to the numeric phase. Diagnostics are order-stable and name
the stale file, the observed phase, and the expected phase; malformed or
missing declarations fail explicitly.

Focused tests: ten phase-weld tests in the labels plans module covering
agreement, each stale copy, zero and two active cards, malformed and missing
declarations, a gate without a phase card, and traversal-order independence.

### T9 — Refresh compiler status documentation · `task:review:compiler-status-drift`

**Priority:** P2
**Status:** DONE

Repair: the compiler crate Rustdoc lists the implemented internal stages and
the remaining absent work, and keeps the boundary statement that no public
value can be mistaken for a completed analysis. The compiler package
contract and the packages index carry an accurate status and milestone
states, and the phase card separates delivered-analysis requirements from
the open placement, coverage, and pilot deliverables. The stale-phrase sweep
found two current-state matches; both were corrected.

Verification: compiler package tests, a warning-free Rustdoc build, and the
plans check all passed.

## 6. Phase-2 implementation queue · `sec:backlog:phase2`

### 6.1 Summary · `tab:backlog:phase2`

### 6.2 Completed foundation

The following are implemented internally and remain subject to their package
tests and owner validation:

```text
P2-001  realization boundary
P2-002  Petgraph review
P2-003  compiler crate and error root
P2-004  compiler input binding
P2-005  relation/expression DAGs
P2-006  checked constant folding
P2-007  exact proof planning, reaccepted
P2-008  source, constructibility, and disclosure analysis
P2-009  representation lifecycle
P2-010  execution-case placement and layout requirements
P2-011  relation-indexed coverage requirements
```

No complete analyzed-program public API is exposed yet. This is deliberate:
partial analyses must not be mistaken for a completed compiler result.

### P2-007 — Repair and reaccept exact proof planning · `task:phase2:proof-planning`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** T6, T7, P2-005, P2-006
**Blocks:** P2-010 through P2-013

Reaccepted after T6 and T7 closed; the gate record is in §2.8.

Reacceptance required, and the recorded evidence establishes:

1. every in-scope relation classified exactly once;
2. every approved proof alternative retained or rejected for a typed reason;
3. external-evidence capabilities validated;
4. proof/representation compatibility applied completely;
5. capability and source requirements consistent;
6. hard constraints applied before objective or candidate retention;
7. exact feasible set compared with an independently derived exhaustive oracle;
8. no partial result on complexity exhaustion;
9. deterministic candidate ordering and equality under declaration
   permutations.

The search retains the exact feasible set; it does not silently select one
candidate under an unstated target policy.

### P2-010 — Derive execution-case placement and layout requirements · `task:phase2:placement`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** accepted P2-007, P2-008, P2-009, C1-009
**Blocks:** P2-011 and P2-012

Delivered in the Guide-5 batch; the gate record and evidence are in §2.9.

Relations are classified per execution case on independent axes — discharge
boundary, semantic scope, activation, and carrier multiplicity — rather than
one local/global/conditional/duplicated category. Execution cases expand only
the sponsor dimension; the representation is fixed by each feasible proof
plan. Every active runtime relation case has an eligible abstract carrier;
carrier eligibility, exact feasible placement sets, and target-independent
layout requirements are validated against an independent exhaustive oracle.
Complexity limits are explicit typed parameters and exhaustion returns no
partial result. No target bytes or concrete target positions enter this
stage.

### P2-011 — Derive relation-indexed coverage requirements · `task:phase2:coverage`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** P2-010, C1-010, C1-013
**Blocks:** P2-012

Delivered in the Guide-6 batch; the gate record and evidence are in §2.10.

Exact equality holds among the realization relation scope, the compiler
relation scope, the relation-case plan scope, and the coverage scope. Every
active relation-case carries positive and negative requirements at each of
its boundaries, a carrier requirement when runtime-carried, and an accepted
semantic-projection requirement; inactive relation-cases carry an explicit
inactive-valid requirement; conditional relations satisfy the
inactive-valid, active-valid, active-invalid triplet across the case set,
and representation modes are covered across the complete feasible plan
set. A broad operation test does not substitute for relation coverage.

### P2-012 — Analyze both pilots end to end · `task:phase2:pilots`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** T6, T7, P2-005 through P2-011
**Blocks:** P2-013

Delivered in the Guide-7 batch; the gate record and evidence are in §2.11.

Both pilots analyze end to end into one validated scoped analyzed program
per scope: the acceptance relation lists are the exact relation censuses,
every requirement in the acceptance matrices holds, rejected proof and
representation pairings are absent from the plan set, repeated analysis
from equal typed inputs produces equal stable projections, and the
combined two-pilot scope stores per-operation factors whose product
equals the retired global enumeration exactly. The analyzed value claims
no deployment lifecycle completeness: the pilots retain their future
target and operation obligations explicitly.

### P2-013 — Phase-2 evidence and exit · `gate:backlog:phase2`

**Priority:** Gate
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** T6–T9, P2-004 through P2-012, C1-005, C1-008,
C1-009, C1-010, C1-013

Passed; the complete exit evidence is the Guide-7 gate record in §2.11,
including the declared-MSRV and current-stable lanes, the meson-required
CI run, the explicit product regressions, and passed document byte
reproducibility. Every exit condition held: findings closed, censuses
exact, capabilities failing closed, deterministic pilot analysis,
independent oracles agreeing, gates recorded, current-phase declarations
moving together, and a clean final tree.

Phase completion does not itself justify a persistent compiler digest;
none was minted.

## 7. Immediate algorithm preparation · `sec:backlog:algorithms`

### 7.2 C1-008 — Proof-plan search reacceptance

Reaccepted in the Guide-4 batch, gate record §2.8. The recorded evidence
establishes each former condition:

- external-evidence capability requirements are retained;
- representation-sensitive proofs are checked against selected modes;
- candidate capabilities and sources agree;
- the independent oracle derives those rules independently;
- infeasibility and complexity exhaustion remain distinct;
- no partial result is returned.

### 7.3 C1-009 — Execution-case-aware placement

Delivered in the Guide-5 batch with P2-010; the gate record is in §2.9.
Every active relation case is covered by an eligible carrier, production
search is compared with an independent exhaustive assignment oracle on
small instances and both pilot scopes, and the adversarial case list —
optional-carrier defects, global-on-local defects, source unavailability,
duplicate enforcement, permutation equality, and both budget exhaustions —
is retained as focused regressions.

### 7.4 C1-010 — Typed symbols and SCC policy

Delivered in the Guide-6 batch within the coverage scope; the gate record is
in §2.10. Two-pass typed resolution runs a complete definition census before
complete reference resolution; duplicate keys, unknown references, and
cross-operation references fail; SCC members and diagnostics are normalized
by stable key and every current cycle is rejected. SCC membership does not
authorize a semantic cycle — an accepted cycle would require a new typed
resolution strategy and policy review. This work prepares linker policy but
pulled no linker or target types into compiler core.

### 7.5 C1-013 — Independent algorithm oracles

| Production analysis | Independent oracle |
|---|---|
| canonical topology | valid-order enumeration plus least-key rule |
| SCC | mutual-reachability equivalence |
| expression interning | non-interned evaluator |
| dependency closure | repeated complete scan |
| proof selection | exhaustive candidate enumeration with independently derived hard constraints |
| placement | exhaustive carrier subsets |
| relation census | direct set equality |
| constant folding | non-folded evaluator |
| stable projection | declaration-order permutation |
| coverage | direct relation × case matrix equality |

The proof-selection oracle must not call the same obligation-classification or
compatibility helper as production for the property it is meant to verify.

Delivered across the Guide-5 and Guide-6 batches: the placement oracle in
§2.9; the relation-by-case coverage oracle, the repeated-scan collateral
oracle, and the mutual-reachability SCC oracle in §2.10. Each restates its
hard predicates independently of the production helper it verifies.

## 8. Dependency posture · `sec:backlog:dependencies`

### 8.1 Current and deferred dependencies · `tab:backlog:dependencies`

| Dependency | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `petgraph = 0.8.3` | Adopted and reviewed; `serde-1` only | Graph storage and standard algorithms |
| `num-bigint` | Existing | Exact arbitrary-size integers |
| `num-integer` | Existing | Exact integer helpers |
| `num-traits` | Existing | Numeric traits |
| `proptest` | Existing | Property and independent-oracle testing |
| `num-rational` | Deferred | Future exact-rational consumer |
| `faer` | Deferred | Future certified numerical diagnostics |
| `fixedbitset` | Deferred | Dense local coverage sets if measured |
| Elements libraries | Phase-3 review | Target transaction and consensus types |
| SAT/LP/MILP solver | Deferred | Larger exact planning only after measured need |
| `salsa` | Deferred | Incremental compiler queries |
| `egg` | Deferred | Equality saturation |
| `rayon` | Removed and deferred | Requires measured need and schedule-independent results |

The latest static review excluded `Cargo.lock`; no lockfile claim is made by
that review.

### 8.2 Dependency-entry rule · `rule:backlog:dependency-entry`

A deferred dependency enters only when:

1. a concrete consumer exists;
2. current implementation demonstrates missing functionality;
3. simpler exact first-party code is insufficient;
4. source, version, licence, MSRV, unsafe boundary, transitive graph,
   determinism, and advisories are reviewed;
5. public API leakage is considered;
6. focused tests and an independent oracle exist;
7. lockfile changes are reviewed;
8. required gates remain green and clean.

Unused dependencies are not added to advertise intent.

---

## 9. Mathematical and algorithmic laws · `sec:backlog:laws`

### 9.1 Exactness · `rule:backlog:exactness`

Semantic, conservation, authorization, identity, calibration, and release
claims use:

- checked bounded integers;
- arbitrary-precision integers;
- reduced exact rationals;
- exact finite search;
- independently checked certificates;
- target-native execution where the claim concerns the target.

A floating residual is diagnostic evidence, not exact equality.

### 9.2 Handles and identity · `rule:backlog:handles`

Always distinguish:

```text
local handle:
    process-local graph, arena, matrix, or solver position

stable key:
    complete typed semantic identity

digest:
    optional domain-separated commitment, admitted per the
    identity adjudication procedure
```

Never use as semantic identity:

- Petgraph indices;
- matrix positions;
- solver variable numbers;
- insertion or traversal order;
- source path or line;
- pivot order;
- floating-point bits;
- thread schedule;
- temporary path.

### 9.3 Complexity failure · `rule:backlog:complexity`

An analysis exceeding its explicit budget returns a typed complexity error.

It must not:

- drop a relation;
- weaken authorization;
- increase disclosure silently;
- remove a lifecycle exit;
- switch to an undocumented greedy fallback;
- claim optimality from incomplete search;
- accept the best partial result seen before exhaustion.

### 9.4 Evidence separation · `rule:backlog:evidence-separation`

Keep separate:

- typed validation;
- capability availability;
- witness/source availability;
- model execution;
- realization conformance;
- compiler completeness;
- backend pattern evidence;
- linked-bundle execution;
- target consensus/policy results;
- event projection;
- attestation query;
- receipt accounting;
- calibration;
- release validation.

A report or status from one class never silently satisfies another.

In particular:

```text
target capability exists
≠
required evidence was produced

sponsor role structure is valid
≠
substrate conservation was evidenced

model relation is conformant
≠
deployment is ready
```

---

## 10. Verification matrix · `sec:backlog:verification`

### 10.1 Working cadence

For Rust changes:

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

Do not run the full Meson/release surface after every small edit.

Documentation-only changes do not require the Rust lane, but they still require
the relevant documentation and census checks.

### 10.2 Focused commands · `tab:backlog:focused-tests`

| Area | Command |
|---|---|
| architecture/profile | `cargo test -p tripod-architecture` |
| realization | `cargo test -p tripod-realization` |
| compiler | `cargo test -p tripod-compiler` |
| compiler planning | `cargo test -p tripod-compiler proof` |
| compiler oracle | `cargo test -p tripod-compiler oracle` |
| model conformance | `cargo test -p tripod-model realization_conformance` |
| model bounds | `cargo test -p tripod-model bound_conformance` |
| artifacts | `cargo test -p tripod-artifacts` |
| labels/plans | `cargo test -p tripod-labels` |
| checker report/stamps | `cargo test -p cli-common` |
| document stamps | `cargo test -p tripod-document-stamps` |
| flattener | `cargo test -p flatten-latex-main` |
| process wrapper | `cargo test -p execwrap` |
| mocked Meson graph | `meson test -C build meson-mock-contract` |
| executor classification | `meson test -C build executor-classification` |

Focused filters supplement but never replace complete package and workspace
runs. Every gate lane is a Meson test (CI-009), so any of them narrows the
same way: `scripts/ci.sh --suite lint`, or a lane by name.

### 10.3 Full gate

After a completed batch:

```sh
scripts/ci.sh
meson compile -C build
meson test -C build --print-errorlogs
```

The first line is the whole lane surface with the TeX toolchain mocked; the
second and third add the real document build, which the mocked run cannot
cover. `scripts/ci.sh` is a shim over `meson test` and forwards its arguments,
and `scripts/ci-timing-report.py` reads the finished run's logs for the
per-suite, per-lane, and per-test timing.

The canonical build directory is `build/`.

Use:

```sh
meson setup build
```

only if `build/` does not exist.

For a complete release-oriented result, additionally run the required MSRV and
stable lanes and the separate byte-reproducibility check:

```sh
scripts/check-document-reproducibility.sh
```

### 10.4 Documentation and census

```sh
scripts/check-plans.sh
meson compile -C build lint
git diff --check
git diff --cached --check
```

Every new tracked subject must join its nearest `meson.build` census.

### 10.5 Dependency and advisory evidence

```sh
cargo tree -e features
cargo metadata
cargo audit
```

A missing `cargo-audit` is recorded as skipped, never passed.

### 10.6 Clean repository

The final check is:

```sh
git status --porcelain=v1 --untracked-files=all
```

It must be empty.

### 10.7 Execution trust

Repository source, tests, Cargo manifests, Meson definitions, scripts, TeX,
and `.latexmkrc` are executable.

Untrusted contributions run only in an externally established,
credential-free isolated environment under ADR-015. A clean-tree result is a
correctness check, not malicious-code containment.

## 11. Current gate · `gate:backlog:current`

The Phase-2 gate is **passed** (§2.11), the Phase-3 gate is
**passed** (§2.6 with the Phase-3 card), and the Phase-4 gate is
**passed** (§2.8). No Phase-5 charter exists yet: the next gate arrives
with Guide 13.

The Guide-8 target foundation is complete; the gate record is §2.12. The
Phase-3 task state is:

| ID | Status | Task |
|---|---|---|
| `T3-001` | DONE | Typed target package boundary |
| `T3-002` | DONE | Reviewed initial target definition |
| `T3-003` | DONE | Encoding and opcode contracts |
| `T3-004` | DONE | Development deployment binding |
| `T3-005` | DONE | Compiler capability adapter |
| `T3-006` | DONE | Target-native primitive conformance, gate record §2.13 |

| `T3-009` | DONE | Exact wide floor-arithmetic prototype accepted, gate record §2.14 |
| `T3-010` | DONE | Public-declassification initial policy selected, gate record §2.4 |

The Phase-4 task state follows Guide 12's wave plan, from
(`task:guide12-exec:wave4`) onward; each wave lands with its own
evidence and the batch gate record extends §2.6:

| ID | Status | Task |
|---|---|---|
| `T4-001` | DONE | Validated compact-ASH target operation plan — compiler `operation_plan` public boundary, projections recomputed against the analysis (23 relations, 2 cases, 46 relation-cases, 69 layout requirements), Guide-11 representation stated, nine corruption oracles |
| `T4-002` | DONE | Target transaction-form and dependency review — target-elements `transaction_form`, fee role recognized by form, both forms consensus-admitted, sponsor asset explicit and value uninspected, first-party substrate selected awaiting dependency ratification, three requirements deferred to transaction evidence |
| `T4-003` | DONE | Static target assessment and typed tapscript proof patterns — tapscript `shape`, `policy`, `pattern`, `operation_assessment`; `CompactAshShape` minted and the (`rule:guide12-exec:plan-selection`) tie-break stated in `CompactAshBackendPolicy`; eight pattern identities earned by machine-checked schedules; all 79 plan requirements assessed (74 complete-pattern, 3 structural, 2 external evidence) with emission admissible |
| `T4-004` | DONE | Candidate relocatable bundle — tapscript `bundle`; static ASH constructor over 9 shapes as 9 coordinator leaves and 3 recomputation-shared member leaves, 3939 exact encoded bytes, 61 relocations located by rebuilding each program with one symbol replaced plus 9 introspection references read from the emitted instructions, candidate status held by construction refusing a release-complete plan and by a read-only artifact status |
| `T4-005` | DONE | Linker foundation — `packages/linker`; two-pass resolution over 22 typed symbols of which 21 are defined, frozen reference graph whose one strongly connected component is the ASH constructor's self-commitment, 61 relocations applied by structured substitution to 3975 exact encoded bytes, deterministic 12-leaf taptree checked against an exact subset oracle that is itself checked against literal enumeration, `ControlPathDepth` settled at 4, all 30 relation-cases uniquely carried; the demonstration link refused without an explicit authenticated strategy for the self-commitment, which is the finding this wave was for |
| `T4-005a` | DONE | Self-commitment resolved by identity introspection — the recognition fragments read the constructor's program off the input the leaf is spending instead of pushing a literal for it, which is the resolution the Wave-8 refusal named; `AshConstructorProgramVersion` retired, `AshConstructorProgram` rebound `ReadFromTargetAtSpendTime` and carried by an introspection-reference census, the sound strategy now links with no equality outstanding, and every emitted program shrank (coordinator model base 116 to 85 and per-ash-input 109 to 78, member 102 to 64) |
| `T4-006` | DONE | Candidate transaction ABI — `packages/transaction`; the ABI states every item Guide-12 section 15.4 lists over the 9 admitted shapes, with a first-party explicit-field encoder and decoder checked against hand-written byte strings (193 sponsorless, 374 sponsored) and control blocks over a committed tree checked against digests computed outside the crate; the three whole-transaction dimensions settle per constructed transaction; the taproot output key is pinned rather than recomputed and the pin-against-tree equality is carried as an outstanding obligation |
| `T4-007` | DONE | Canonical semantic and target fixtures — `packages/vectors`; the complete Guide-12 section-18 matrix transcribed as 153 named classes each naming its polarity, mutation layer, and expected section-1.5 boundary; canonical and experimental standing separated by a type whose canonical constructor is crate-private and has no promotion path; the section-16.4 evidence plan recomputing every census two ways and comparing them (23 relations, 2 cases, 46 relation-cases of which 4 vacuous, 211 coverage requirements split 139 positive and 72 negative), the section-1.3 relation closure checked in both directions; 14 positive semantic cases carrying no target vocabulary, with the successor derived from the realization layer's own checked sum, and 9 of them materialized to exact byte-stable target transactions; no coverage row discharged, every row naming why it is outstanding |
| `T4-008` | DONE | Real target execution (Waves 11 and 12): the section 16.2 edge end to end, twelve vectors — eight sponsorless, four sponsored under the test-scoped authorization capability — accepted and mined at the pinned genesis, all twelve matched on the thirteen section 17.4 terms, coverage 99 of 211, three byte-identical runs per wave. Full narrative archived in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md) |
| `T4-012` | DONE | Issuance bisect: the refusal `bad-txns-in-ne-out` traced to the witness-section guard ahead of `VerifyIssuanceAmount` — a balance diagnostic for a non-balance condition — and fixed first-party by funding through the witness-carrying program form; filed upstream as EG-021. Full narrative archived in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md) |
| `T4-013` | DONE | Kept and reclassified: the `maximum` fixture stands at the protocol's 51-bit bound, `vectors::divergence` derives the row's standing against the reviewed stated-amount bound, and the divergent row was refused live with excess while the other eight submitted. Full narrative archived in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md) |
| `T4-009` | TODO | Negative relation coverage (Waves 13–13e): the mutation machinery, the derived class-to-requirement link, per-mutation funding, three section-18 boundary respecs proven against live evidence, and one negative row discharged. Open honestly: 71 of 72 negative rows outstanding, each naming its reason in code; the remedy is the three guide gaps, filed as [the Guide-13 feature requests](guides/guide_thirteen_feature_requests.md), not more first-party tests. Full narrative archived in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md) |
| `T4-010` | DONE | Candidate resource study (Wave 14): all thirty-six section 20.2 assignments measured, twelve live weights matched against prediction, and the finding that linking — seven of thirty-six under the sixteen-leaf oracle budget — is the candidate ceiling, not any target bound. Full narrative archived in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md) |
| `T4-011` | DONE | Phase-4 gate and handoff (Wave 15): the section-29 audit dispositioned 105 items (94 PASS, 5 QUALIFIED, 1 honest FAIL, 5 deferred), the completion report filed at [the Guide-12 completion record](history/guide-12-completion-report.md), and the deferred lanes discharged by the §2.8 gate run locally as the verdict of record. Full narrative archived in [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md) |

The Phase-5 task state follows Guide 13's wave plan, from its Wave 0
preflight onward; each wave lands with its own evidence:

| Task | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `T5-001` | DONE | Guide-13 Wave 0 preflight reproduction: all eighteen review rows dispositioned. Sixteen CONFIRMED with committed reproductions in six packages — a confirmed defect is an ignored test stating the property the repair must establish, so the repair un-ignores or replaces it and nothing rounds up. `G13-R09` closed by the phase-state reconciliation. `G13-R06` RECLASSIFIED: the four quoted logging sites are the accepted `G12-R04` repair — the harness nulls the adapter's stderr, and ADR-010's implementation scope is the cli-common executables — with the direct-run scenario left as a question for the guide author. `G13-R18` CONFIRMED on all four sub-claims: blank records skipped, no byte bound, the handshake accepts unknown fields, and exactly one of the five framing cases the Rust side distinguishes exists in the reader. Two couplings the review did not draw: the live lane publishes its coverage through the forgeable discharge API, so `G13-R01` and `G13-R12` repair together, and one caller-authored tuple was measured discharging forty-two rows. Integration lane green on the shared instance: clippy 7.5s, the workspace suite 339.9s |

Current blockers are:

```text
Phase-4 work:
    real target execution (T4-008) is closed. T4-012 and T4-013 are
    closed with it, and a live node has run the whole lane in both
    execution cases: the ceremony issues its asset, observes the chain's
    reserve, funds twelve rows, records the thirteenth as a money-bound
    divergence, and submits all twelve, which the target accepted and
    mined. The section 17.4 comparison ran against every acceptance and
    all twelve matched, discharging 99 of the 211 coverage requirements.
    The sponsor authorization is the executor's and is test-scoped by
    construction; what the run establishes is what the candidate owes.
    One row is left unanswered by this candidate rather than by this
    target: the two-member sponsor region is above the demonstration
    bounds, so no program for its shape was ever emitted, and reaching
    it needs a candidate linked under wider bounds
```

Standing rules that survive the phase exit:

- Phases 1 and 2 remain evidence about their recorded trees;
- no compiler public complete-analysis API is frozen;
- no public realization/compiler digest is minted without a real consumer;
- target-specific fields remain forbidden in realization and compiler core;
- no stable linker or transaction ABI exists;
- no floating value or local graph handle enters semantic identity;
- no draft bound becomes deployment calibration;
- no raw report digest is treated as evidence identity without typed role and
  subject binding;
- no self-consistent model checkpoint is described as independent
  target-chain evidence;
- no architecture, model, realization, hash, build, or test success is
  described as deployment readiness;
- no current checkout is described as green without a fresh complete execution
  record.

## 12. Execution order · `sec:backlog:order`

Execute in this order unless reproduction changes dependencies:

```text
1. Follow Guide 13's wave order for Phase 5; no implementation wave
   begins before the preflight register closes its confirmed P0 and
   P1 rows, the entry is the recorded Phase-4 exit in §2.8, and no
   wave skips its predecessor's typed handoff.
2. Keep target types out of compiler core; the target packages consume
   the analyzed boundary, never the reverse.
3. Mint no target hash and claim no production activation without a real
   consumer and reviewed evidence.
```

No new hash, target prototype, report field, or publication may defer a current
typed-boundary or correctness repair.

## 13. Adopted-draft integration queue · `sec:backlog:drafts`

Four externally authored normative drafts were accepted 2026-08-16, audited (28 findings), corrected upstream by the author, and re-adopted and
archived verbatim under [plans/drafts/](drafts/README.md): the label
calculus, the environment-kind registry, the identity-adjudication
procedure, and the interchange conventions. Integration is chartered as
its own batch; the drafts bind nothing until the integrating changes
land. The user has ruled that a superseded ADR is deleted, not kept
marked superseded: retired records belong to Git history, not the
active tree.

### 13.1 Integration tasks

The draft-integration queue stood here and is closed: every DI row is
DONE or withdrawn, the queue was discharged by the draft-promotion
batch (gate record §2.5), and the table moved verbatim, with its
label, to [backlog history](history/backlog-history.md); §13.1
references resolve to the heading of that number there.

### 13.2 Checker findings so far · `tab:backlog:draft-findings`

A finding identifier is a permanent key. It names one finding for good,
so a resolved row stays here with its status rather than being deleted
into git history, and a resolved identifier is never reissued.

Two rows once shared `DI-F02`. The one still numbered so is the standing
finding the DI-001 gap census restates under that identifier; the other
was a narrower defect found while repairing it, which took the same
number by accident and now carries the next free one, `DI-F04`. Renaming
the standing finding instead would have moved an identifier the census
already cites (G11-R12).

| ID | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| `DI-F01` | DONE | The plans-tree link scanner read bracketed patterns inside fenced blocks as Markdown links, so a CDDL regex in an archived draft failed as a broken link. Fenced interiors are now blanked before link scanning; the systematic single-scanner repair landed as DI-003 W1, which folded this blanking into the shared scanner. |
| `DI-F04` | DONE | The Realization harvest computed the boundaries of the generated upward-citation index from the raw source while reading its spans from the fence-aware scanner. A section heading displayed inside a fenced block therefore opened the index region, which stayed open across the fence close and swallowed the body citation below it, losing an anchor and reporting the genuine index stale. The region walk now reads participating lines only. Found and resolved by DI-003 W1; no occurrence existed in the tree, so no diagnostic moved. |
| `DI-F02` | DONE | Participation is enforced inconsistently across checks: the label scanner honors fences, the link scanner did not, and the scaffolding, placeholder, and confidence hygiene checks still scan fenced material. One participation model must feed every check. Closed by DI-003 W1, which landed exactly that single shared scanner. |
| `DI-F05` | OPTIONAL | Wave 4 observed that the DI-001 gap census and this table describe `DI-F01` through `DI-F03` in different terms, so a reader reconciling them must infer which wording is authoritative. The identifiers and statuses agree; the drift is semantic, in what each row is said to be about. Optional cleanup: state one wording as the finding and let the other cite it. No diagnostic and no gate depends on the difference. |
| `DI-F06` | DONE | The carrier stopped at the Python adapter, so the two frictions adapting only in `scripts/elements-native-executor.py` could not be cited. Closed by ADR-023, amending two ADR-019 rows: the partition gains `scripts/*.py` to `DOC`, and scanned regions gain Python comments with every string form excluded. Both sites now carry citations their register rows name. Deleting the `eg-007` mint failed the check at the Python site; restoring it returned valid. |
| `DI-F03` | DONE | The calculus's owner signatures, imported-citation prefixes, synthetic citations, anchor harvests, and acute-delimiter hard failure are only partially realized in the present checker; the gap census of DI-001 owns the exact delta. Closed by DI-003: W1 and W2 landed the owner signatures with registered prefixes, the imported and synthetic citations, the anchor harvests, and the kind registry as the checker's kind vocabulary; the acute-delimiter hard failure is enforced in `participation.rs` and asserted by `an_unclosed_opening_acute_fails_at_its_delimiter`. |

### 13.3 Toolchain engineering · `tab:backlog:toolchain-tasks`

| ID | Status | Task |
|---|---|---|
| `CI-001` | DONE (superseded by `CI-009`) | Rewrite the shell CI driver in Python with a typed lane tracker: every lane declared with status and skip reason, every lane and the whole run wall-timed, and a timing report emitted as the success output and on failure alike. Delivered as scripts/ci.py with an eleven-lane registry and the ci.sh shim; the first dataset shows the two test lanes at eighty-four percent of a twenty-minute gate. The dataset is what the row was for, and it holds; the driver that produced it does not. `CI-009` retired scripts/ci.py outright, because meson's harness already declares, times, and statuses every lane, and a second registry of the same lanes is a second thing that can disagree with the first. |
| `CI-002` | FOLDED into `CI-009` | Move test execution to the meson layer per the user's ruling: no workspace-level cargo test in the gate; each package's test groups run as individual meson-driven lanes, and per-test timing uses the nightly libtest JSON output, which the user has admitted as not affecting what the tests prove. The timing report gains per-package and per-test figures; attribution replaces the aggregate block. Contention on the shared cargo target directory is measured and the chosen serialization or partitioning recorded honestly. |
| `CI-003` | DONE | User ruling: the generated registers are archive-budget, by role not directory; labels/README.md stays prose. Combined 783755 to 724577 bytes; archive 1168518 to 1228130. |
| `CI-004` | DONE | Second half of the same ruling: closed backlog sections move to archived history. New archive-class directory plans/history/ holds the twelve completed gate records (§2.3–2.14) and the four remediated review registers (§5.2–5.5), moved verbatim with their labels; the backlog keeps a numbered stub at each origin. plans/README.md now separates superseded prose, which is deleted, from a closed record, which moves. Combined 786243 to 744305 bytes, headroom 189 to 42127. |
| `CI-005` | TODO | The workspace test lane costs too much for what most changes need (user, 2026-08-19). Two halves. First, honor the cadence the backlog already states: §10.1 exempts documentation-only changes from the Rust lane, yet the working ritual has been running the full workspace suite before every commit regardless of content — the promotion batch itself proved the corpus oracle for documentation edits is the label/plans/forbidden-text checker run plus register regeneration, with the workspace suite contributing nothing to those edits. The per-change cadence becomes content-scoped: documentation-only tranches run the checker oracle alone, Rust tranches run the focused package lanes of §10.2 plus clippy, and the full workspace lane runs once per batch before merge rather than per commit. Second, measure where the workspace wall time actually goes with the per-test timing CI-002 already charters, and split or serialize the worst suites so the full lane itself gets cheaper. Third, the user's deeper ruling: wall time is a first-class concept — every lane, test, and gate reports its duration or that silence is itself a defect to report; each recurring action carries an expected-duration budget beside its definition, and exceeding budget is a finding. |
| `CI-006` | DONE (sweep only) | Wave-1a worker finding, 2026-08-20: every workspace manifest named its lint groups in kebab case — nine names of the pattern `lints.rust.deprecated-safe` through `unsafe-code` per manifest — and cargo warned for each that the name will not work in a future edition, roughly ninety warnings on every build. The mechanical snake-case sweep is done: only the workspace root carried the nine keys (package manifests just inherit via `[lints] workspace = true`), the rename landed there, and a clippy lane confirms zero warnings of that class. Still open: one recorded decision, `PointParityConvention::ImpliedEvenY` documents the x-only convention but became formally unconstructible when `G12-R10` made the convention derive from the prefix pair, so either a future encoding earns it or the variant is removed. |
| `CI-007` | DONE (deletion) | Wave-1b worker findings, 2026-08-20, dispositioned by user ruling: the dead executor smoke script `scripts/test-elements-native-executor.sh` — unrunnable since revision 3 landed, hidden behind its live-node skip — is deleted outright rather than patched; rebuilding a native-executor smoke test is proper engineering and stands as the low-priority row `CI-010`. The second finding, no Python test lane anywhere in CI, is subsumed by the `CI-009` migration ruling: the lane arrives as a first-class meson test, not as a `ci.py` registry entry. |

| `CI-008` | DONE | Wave-2 worker finding and repair, 2026-08-20: the combined-Markdown headroom CI-004 restored was spent. The base tree measured 785909 bytes against the 786432 hard cap — 523 bytes — so the Wave-2 register rows could not be written at all without failing the plans lane, and a lane could no longer record its own evidence. Repaired by the mechanism CI-004 built, on the record that had just become eligible for it: §5.9's preflight register is complete, so it moved verbatim to history with a numbered stub at its origin, and the combined figure returned to about 762 kilobytes. Two things to watch rather than rediscover: the headroom is consumed by whichever wave is recording evidence, at roughly a kilobyte a row, and the next eligible record is not obvious — §5.7 still carries an OPEN P0 and §13 an ACTIVE row, so neither is movable yet. |
| `CI-009` | DONE | User ruling 2026-08-20: `ci.py` is dead weight — the CI driver migrates to the meson layer and test execution becomes first class there, completing what CI-002 started rather than growing the Python registry further. Deliverables: every `ci.py` lane restated as a meson test or target with its timing reported by meson's own harness; a first-class Python test lane for node-free executor logic, carrying the exhaustive script-error mapped-message check from the `G12-R07` repair; `ci.sh` reduced to a thin shim or retired; the wall-time budgets restated per lane where meson reports them. CI-002 folds into this row. Delivered: scripts/ci.py is deleted and scripts/ci.sh is a shim that configures the mocked build directory, runs `meson test`, and prints the timing report. Four lanes were not yet meson tests and are now — `tracked-path-argv-audit`, `cargo-audit`, `meson-mock-contract`, `clean-tree` — with the advisory lane exiting 77 so meson reports its own SKIP rather than a private vocabulary. The Python lane is `executor-classification`, an exhaustive node-free oracle over the executor's script-error classification that fails on the pre-`G12-R07` parser. Per-lane budgets sit beside each `test()` call in meson.build, cold and warm figures stated separately where they differ by more than a factor. Evidence: 47 of 47 lanes green through `scripts/ci.sh` under the nightly SDK toolchain, 2026-08-20 — 48:29 total on a cold target directory, of which 33:20 is the test phase and the rest the debug and release warm-up builds. The release suite is 30:30 of that test phase and the debug suite 15:45, so the two Rust suites remain the whole cost of the gate, which is the measurement CI-005 argues its cadence from. Per-test attribution survives the driver in scripts/ci-timing-report.py, which reads the finished run's logs and gates nothing. One explicit exception, stated rather than dropped: `scripts/check-document-reproducibility.sh` stays a script, because it builds the document twice in disposable directories and refuses a dirty worktree, so it answers a release question and cannot be a lane of the run whose cleanliness it depends on. |
| `CI-010` | LOW | User ruling 2026-08-20: rebuild the native-executor smoke test as proper engineering, replacing the deleted revision-2 script. It speaks protocol revision 4, exercises the real handshake against a live node, is validated in a session that holds one, and fails loudly rather than skipping silently when its preconditions are absent. Blocked on a live node like the rest of Wave 11. |

## 14. Backlog hygiene · `sec:backlog:hygiene`

### 13.1 Adding work · `rule:backlog:add`

A new task states:

- phase or lane;
- priority and status;
- dependencies;
- concrete output;
- assurance class;
- affected files and packages;
- focused exit test;
- verification command;
- identity and schema impact;
- dependency impact.

A new digest additionally satisfies
(`req:identity:admission-record`).

### 13.2 Splitting work · `rule:backlog:split`

Split a task when it:

- crosses semantic, compiler, linker, target, transaction, evidence, or release
  ownership;
- mixes exact correctness with numerical diagnostics;
- mixes dependency adoption with algorithm acceptance;
- combines independent security consequences;
- contains one part that can complete while another remains research-blocked.

### 13.3 Dropping or parking work · `rule:backlog:drop`

A dropped or parked task records:

- why it is unnecessary or premature;
- supporting evidence;
- activation condition;
- replacement, if any;
- identity and release consequences.

“No present consumer” is sufficient reason to park an identity, report digest,
dependency, or publication.

### 13.4 Retention · `rule:backlog:retention`

After a phase or remediation series:

- move durable evidence into the owning phase card, ADR, decision, research
  result, release record, or annotated tag;
- retain permanent task IDs in compact tables;
- delete implementation diaries from the active backlog;
- rely on Git history rather than creating a second archive under `plans/`;
- keep only current and immediately preparatory work detailed here.

## 15. One-line backlog · `rem:backlog:one-line`

> Execute Guide 13 — Phase 5 live receipt transfer: close the Wave-0 preflight register first (no live-transfer implementation while a confirmed P0 or P1 row stays open), then build the owner-authorized, representation-parametric transfer pipeline through real target execution, keeping safety and minimality evidence separate, every artifact candidate-only, and no production claim minted.
