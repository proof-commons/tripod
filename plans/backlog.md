# Tripod Implementation Backlog

> **Status:** ACTIVE
> **Current gate:** Phase 3 — Elements target and foundational prototypes
> **Current condition:** Phases 1 and 2 are complete. The target-independent compiler constructs one deterministic, validated scoped analyzed program for the complete pilot scope, factorized per operation, with relation-owned requirements, a corruption-resistant assembly validator, and independent assembly oracles; the Phase-2 exit gate record is in §2.11, including passed document reproducibility. The next work is the Guide-8 typed Elements target contract and capability-adapter foundation.
> **Next gate:** Phase 4 — compact-ash end-to-end pipeline
> **Authority:** Current execution queue only. The specification, the realization document, typed architecture, implemented ADRs, accepted decisions, package contracts, phase cards, and accepted research results take precedence.

This file contains only:

- the current repository and readiness state;
- the latest static-review basis and open findings;
- compact historical milestones and gate records;
- the active Phase-2 compiler queue;
- immediate algorithm preparation;
- dependency posture;
- verification and clean-tree requirements.

Detailed historical implementation narratives belong to Git history, annotated
tags, phase cards, ADRs, accepted decisions, and focused evidence records—not
to the active backlog.

## 1. Backlog contract · `sec:backlog:contract`

### 1.1 Authority · `rule:backlog:authority`

This backlog sequences work. It is not protocol, realization, compiler, target,
ABI, evidence, deployment, or release input.

When artifacts disagree:

| Subject | Owner |
|---|---|
| abstract economic interface | the Attestation specification |
| realization meaning, invariants, obligations, and residuals | the realization document |
| finite registries and stable architecture IDs | typed architecture |
| current executable reference behavior | executable model |
| repository engineering policy | implemented ADRs |
| accepted cross-package implementation direction | planning decisions |
| package boundary | package contract |
| phase entry, deliverables, and exit | phase card |
| unresolved design question | research note |
| current task ordering | this backlog |

A lower owner never overrides an upper owner on the upper owner’s subject.

### 1.2 Status vocabulary · `tbl:backlog:status`

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **TODO** | Ready when its named dependencies are complete. |
| **IN PROGRESS** | Actively being implemented, reviewed, or verified. |
| **BLOCKED** | A named dependency or correctness defect prevents safe progress. |
| **PARKED** | Deliberately inactive until a concrete consumer or measured need exists. |
| **DONE** | Implementation, focused evidence, required gates, documentation, and clean-tree evidence are recorded. |
| **DROPPED** | Deliberately not implemented; rationale and replacement are recorded. |
| **HISTORICAL** | Immutable evidence about an earlier revision; not a claim about the current checkout. |

Code resembling an intended result is not sufficient for `DONE`.

A static-review finding remains open until one of these occurs:

1. the finding is reproduced and fixed with focused coverage;
2. a typed proof shows the reported state is unconstructible;
3. reproduction shows the finding is false;
4. the owning policy or assurance claim is deliberately corrected.

“Existing tests pass” does not close a finding unless a named test reaches the
reported path.

### 1.3 Priority vocabulary · `tbl:backlog:priority`

| Priority | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **P0** | Can manufacture false release, deployment, provenance, or semantic evidence. |
| **P1** | Trusted semantic/evidence boundary defect or active phase blocker. |
| **P2** | Required correctness, determinism, publication, identity, or documentation work before phase exit. |
| **P3** | Maintainability or evidence-quality work required by the active gate. |
| **POST** | Later-phase work that does not block the current gate. |

### 1.4 Definition of done · `rule:backlog:done`

An implementation task is `DONE` only when it records:

1. implementing source files;
2. focused positive and negative tests;
3. affected ADRs, decisions, package contracts, phase cards, or research notes;
4. exact verification commands and outcomes;
5. generated-publication and label impact;
6. semantic, identity, schema, and migration impact;
7. dependency impact;
8. final clean-tree output.

A review finding additionally records whether reproduction confirmed,
refuted, or reclassified it.

A dependency task additionally records:

- selected source and exact version;
- enabled features;
- transitive graph;
- licence;
- MSRV;
- unsafe boundary;
- determinism and parallelism implications;
- advisory status;
- lockfile impact.

A research task additionally records:

- exact question and constraints;
- prototype and tool versions;
- accepted and rejected candidates;
- positive and negative evidence;
- measurements;
- permanent implementation handoff.

### 1.5 Identity admission · `rule:backlog:identity-admission`

No new digest or digest-bearing field enters merely because an object is
important.

A proposed identity must satisfy
(`[ADR016-rule:identity:admission]`) and name:

- the complete typed object or exact bytes;
- owner and producer;
- a present consumer;
- the exact decision the consumer makes;
- assurance class;
- canonical projection and encoding;
- domain separator and recipe identifier;
- stale conditions;
- migration behavior;
- explicit non-claims.

No named consumer means no digest. No distinct decision means no digest.

## 2. Review basis and current evidence · `sec:backlog:review-basis`

### 2.1 Latest static review · `tbl:backlog:review-basis`

The current review is the fifth static review, performed in two independent
passes over the supplied concatenation of the tree:

```text
tree:
   

selected files:
    266
```

The supplied filter excluded, among other things:

```text
Cargo.lock
licence files
the paper sources
packages/artifacts/
packages/cli-common/
packages/document-stamps/
packages/execwrap/
packages/labels/
most unit and integration test directories
some generated files
```

No Cargo, Meson, TeX, the native executor, advisory, or reproducibility
command was run as part of this review.

Therefore:

- the review makes no current green-build claim;
- the excluded packages and test directories received no content review;
- lockfile checksums and resolved features were not independently verified;
- advisory status was not checked;
- licence compatibility was not independently checked;
- historical gate records remain historical evidence only.

Its findings are recorded in §5.5; the review found no obvious valid-world
route in the selected model code for unauthorized issuance, reserve
extraction, receipt-class escape, sponsor-funded payout substitution,
recipient redirection, post-sealing pool revival, or history residue
influencing monetary computation. Its central verdict is that the native
evidence layer can currently say passed without proving the complete claimed
subject was present and covered, and that the static signature abstraction
cannot represent the target's documented empty-signature and unknown-key-type
paths; both must be repaired before Guide-10 prototype evidence is recorded.
The review text is archived at
[plans/reviews/review-5-0.3.3-dev.md](reviews/review-5-0.3.3-dev.md).

### 2.2 Earlier review basis

The repository retains six earlier reviewed trees as historical context:

```text
initial reviewed tree:
   

follow-up reviewed tree:
   

proof-planning reviewed tree:
   

second-review tree:
   

third-review tree:
   

fourth-review tree:
   
```

Those reviews and their findings are evidence about their exact trees. They are
not current-checkout execution evidence. The second through fifth review
texts are archived under [plans/reviews/](reviews/README.md).

### 2.3 Historical Phase-1 gate · `gate:backlog:phase1`

The repository records the Phase-1 evidence tag:

```text
phase1-realization-foundation-v1
```

The tag is the immutable evidence record for its exact commit. Its existence
does not establish that the current checkout passes.

### 2.4 Historical T1–T5 remediation gate · `gate:backlog:t1-t4-remediation`

The repository records a completed remediation batch for T1–T5. Its recorded
result was:

- `scripts/ci.sh`: every available lane passed;
- `cargo-audit`: skipped because unavailable, so the run was partial-green;
- real Meson compile: passed;
- Meson tests: passed;
- document byte reproducibility: deferred;
- final clean-tree check: empty.

This is historical evidence for the remediation tree, not a current-tree gate.

### 2.5 Historical compiler-input gate · `gate:backlog:p2-004`

The repository records a completed P2-004 compiler-input batch:

- typed owner revalidation;
- explicit canonical compiler scope;
- strict analysis policy;
- immutable bound compiler input;
- focused public-API tests;
- available CI and Meson lanes passed;
- advisory lane skipped where unavailable;
- document byte reproducibility deferred because paper inputs were unchanged;
- final clean-tree check empty.

### 2.6 Historical Guide-2 gate · `gate:backlog:guide2`

The repository records a completed Guide-2 batch for:

```text
C1-005
P2-005
P2-006
```

The batch covered:

- scoped relation DAG;
- scoped expression DAG;
- predicate binding;
- checked constant folding;
- independent folding oracle;
- declaration-permutation determinism;
- dependency review for the compiler’s Petgraph edge.

The latest static review did not find a defect in these components.

### 2.7 Historical Guide-3 gate · `gate:backlog:guide3`

The repository records a completed Guide-3 batch for:

```text
C1-008
P2-007
P2-008
P2-009
```

The batch covered:

- relation-obligation classification;
- exact proof-plan enumeration;
- source requirements;
- constructibility;
- disclosure;
- representation lifecycle;
- independent exhaustive planning oracle.

The latest static review found T6 and T7 in this area. The historical gate
remains evidence that its recorded commands passed; it is not evidence that the
tested assertions were complete. P2-007 and C1-008 were therefore reopened as
blocked correctness work and closed again by the Guide-4 batch in §2.8.

### 2.8 Guide-4 reacceptance gate · `gate:backlog:guide4`

The repository records a completed Guide-4 batch for:

```text
T6
T7
T8
T9
C1-008
P2-007
```

The batch covered:

- external-evidence capability retention and fixed-requirement filtering;
- representation relations as static mode constraints;
- an oracle that derives fixed evidence requirements independently;
- the current-phase declaration weld across all four planning entry points;
- accurate compiler implementation-status documentation.

Its recorded result, on the tree ending at the crate-state reconciliation
commit:

- `scripts/ci.sh`: every available lane passed; `cargo-audit` skipped because
  unavailable, so the run was partial-green;
- real Meson compile and test: 10/10 passed, including check-generated
  (architecture publications byte-identical), labels, plans, census, and the
  reproducibility stamps;
- document byte reproducibility: deferred because paper inputs were unchanged;
- final clean-tree check: empty.

Identity impact of the batch: the architecture identity, generated
architecture publications, public schema, and dependency graph are unchanged;
no realization public identity or compiler-plan identity exists.

### 2.9 Guide-5 placement gate · `gate:backlog:guide5`

The repository records a completed Guide-5 batch for:

```text
C1-009
P2-010
```

The batch delivered, all crate-private:

- typed execution cases derived per feasible proof plan (representation
  fixed by the plan; sponsor absent/present the only expansion; four
  semantic cases per pilot across the plan set);
- relation discharge classification on independent axes (boundary, scope,
  activation, multiplicity) with an exhaustive per-variant match;
- abstract carrier roles with input-family coordinator anchors, quantified
  every-member roles, and availability-based eligibility;
- target-independent layout requirements citing relation IDs as semantic
  owners;
- exact feasible placement enumeration with explicit typed limits, no
  partial results, and inclusion-minimal candidate retention;
- an independent exhaustive placement oracle restating every hard
  predicate, agreeing with production on every pilot scope and fifteen
  adversarial synthetic cases;
- end-to-end pilot analysis: two feasible plans per pilot, four cases per
  pilot, 36 feasible placements per compact-ASH plan and 216 per
  live-transfer plan, with the combined scope proven to be the exact
  product of its operations.

Findings recorded for later work:

- multi-operation placement factorizes as a product across operations;
  the analyzed-program work should consider per-operation storage;
- compact ASH declares sponsor recognition without a sponsor cardinality
  relation, so its sponsor family is bounded by no cardinality census;
  live transfer declares both. This is a realization-level asymmetry, not
  a compiler defect.

Its recorded result, on the tree ending at the placement documentation
commit:

- `scripts/ci.sh`: every available lane passed; `cargo-audit` skipped
  because unavailable, so the run was partial-green;
- real Meson compile and test: 10/10 passed, including check-generated,
  labels, plans, census, and the reproducibility stamps;
- document byte reproducibility: deferred because paper inputs were
  unchanged;
- final clean-tree check: empty.

Identity impact of the batch: the architecture identity, generated
architecture publications, public schema, and dependency graph are
unchanged; no compiler-plan identity was minted; placement limits are an
explicit parameter, not public policy.

### 2.10 Guide-6 coverage gate · `gate:backlog:guide6`

The repository records a completed Guide-6 batch for:

```text
P2-011
C1-010
C1-013
```

Sponsor-cardinality ruling: the Guide-5 finding that compact ASH declared
sponsor recognition without sponsor cardinality was confirmed as a
realization omission and repaired. The realization now declares PLAIN_LBTC
input cardinality (minimum zero, maximum the fee-sponsor-input-max bound)
and output cardinality (minimum zero, maximum exactly one) for compact ASH,
with recognition-before-cardinality dependencies, and typed validation
derives the expected family-relation census from the architecture operation
rows so a missing cardinality or recognition relation now fails derivation.
The architecture identity and generated publications are unchanged; both
pilots now have identical placement shape.

The batch delivered, all crate-private:

- relation-indexed coverage requirements: stable boundary-carrying
  requirement identities, an exhaustive typed mutation catalogue with no
  wildcard arm, positive/negative/inactive-valid derivation per boundary,
  per-operation aggregation with no cross-operation product;
- carrier coverage compressed from the feasible placement product
  (216 placements per plan compress to at most three assignment
  alternatives per relation-case) with multiplicity preserved;
- accepted semantic-projection requirements answered by the evidence role
  of their own boundary;
- typed coverage dependencies: two-pass definition census and reference
  resolution, a direct Petgraph graph, strict active-descendant collateral
  closure, canonical SCC diagnostics with cycles forbidden;
- an independent coverage oracle restating the acceptance matrices,
  collateral closure by repeated scan, and SCC by mutual reachability,
  plus property-generated bounded instances;
- end-to-end pilot coverage: two plans and four cases per pilot,
  46 and 48 relation-cases per plan, graphs of 344/365 and 362/489
  nodes/edges, combined scope factorizing per operation, sponsor opacity
  over the complete aggregate projection, determinism under declaration,
  candidate, placement, and relation-case permutations.

Defects surfaced and repaired inside the batch:

- the independent oracle caught the projection binder assigning the
  target-execution evidence role to every boundary's accepted projection;
  each boundary's projection now carries its answering role, guarded in
  the owning module;
- pilot integration removed a quadratic carrier-compression rescan over
  the combined placement product; identical verdicts, polynomial cost.

Its recorded result, on the tree ending at the coverage documentation
commit:

- `scripts/ci.sh`: every available lane passed; `cargo-audit` skipped
  because unavailable, so the run was partial-green;
- real Meson compile and test: 10/10 passed, including check-generated
  (architecture publications byte-identical), labels, plans, census, and
  the reproducibility stamps;
- document byte reproducibility: deferred because paper inputs were
  unchanged;
- final clean-tree check: empty.

Identity impact of the batch: the architecture identity, generated
architecture publications, public schema, and dependency graph are
unchanged; the realization relation census expanded internally to match
architecture cardinalities; no realization or compiler identity exists or
was minted; no new dependency entered.

### 2.11 Guide-7 Phase-2 exit gate · `gate:backlog:guide7`

The repository records the completed Guide-7 batch for:

```text
P2-012
P2-013
C1-014
```

together with the second-review preflight repairs recorded in §5.2.

The batch delivered, all crate-private:

- relation-indexed requirement bundles whose capability, source, and
  evidence unions equal the candidate aggregates exactly in both
  directions;
- factorized operation analysis: cases, relation-case requirement
  bundles, carrier eligibility, placements, layout, coverage, and the
  coverage dependency graph derived per operation, with the existing
  exact search reused unchanged on the operation-restricted census;
- one scoped analyzed program per scope, binding its exact typed source,
  reporting partial architecture scope with the eleven out-of-scope
  operations derived from the architecture census, explicit lifecycle
  incompleteness, and unresolved external evidence, with the execution
  report excluded from the stable semantic projection;
- a corruption-resistant assembly validator rechecking all thirteen
  closure families against fresh component re-derivation, with
  sixty-four corruption mutations each rejected for a focused typed
  reason; coverage closure is exact in both directions, resolving SR2-09;
- an independent assembly census oracle restating every expected census
  without the production expectation derivation, a requirement-union
  oracle, and a two-level factorization oracle;
- end-to-end pilot acceptance: the acceptance relation lists are the
  censuses, rejected proof/mode pairings are absent, and the absence of
  a compiler identity is enforced by two compile-time locks;
- the combined-scope product regressions demoted to explicit phase-exit
  lanes after replacement signal landed, taking the ordinary compiler
  suite from minutes to seconds.

Measured pilot results: 23 and 24 relations, 46 and 48 relation-cases,
216 placements and 69 layout requirements per operation factor, coverage
graphs of 344/365 and 362/489 nodes/edges, 4 combined plans storing 432
placements while denoting the never-materialized 46,656-member product,
2 unresolved substrate-conservation obligations, 3 outstanding lifecycle
exits, 11 of 13 architecture operations outside scope.

Phase-2 exit evidence, on the final batch tree:

- declared MSRV lane, rustc 1.88.0: `scripts/ci.sh` — every available
  lane passed; advisories and the Meson contract skipped in that
  environment;
- current stable lane, rustc 1.97.1: same result, after repairing four
  new stable-toolchain pedantic findings;
- nightly lane with `CI_REQUIRE_MESON=1`: every available lane passed
  including the mocked Meson contract and its census-audit edge;
  advisories skipped;
- real Meson compile and test: 10/10 passed;
- the three explicit product regressions: factor sizes 216 × 216,
  product 46,656, exact set equality against the retired global
  enumeration;
- document byte reproducibility: PASSED — fresh and reused builds
  produce identical PDF bytes, and the reused build refreshes the
  source epoch;
- `cargo-audit`: SKIPPED, tool unavailable; the run is partial in the
  advisory dimension only;
- dependency evidence: `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` unchanged;
- final clean-tree check: empty.

One transient test failure during a deliberately concurrent triple-lane
run did not reproduce in isolation and the affected lane was rerun
uncontended and passed; the recorded results are the uncontended runs.

Identity impact of the batch: Layer-0 version, architecture schema and
hashes, and generated publications unchanged; no realization or compiler
identity exists or was minted; no compiler publication was added; the
deployment-profile identity remains dormant behind validation; no new
dependency entered.

### 2.12 Guide-8 target foundation gate · `gate:backlog:guide8`

The Guide-8 batch delivered the third-review preflight (§5.3, all fifteen
rows), the `tripod-target-elements` crate, the minimal public
compiler target-requirement boundary, and the `tripod-tapscript`
capability adapter. Starting revision 085ef25; batch branch merged
fast-forward after this record.

Preflight: sponsor erasure is fee-sponsor-flow-role based with two-point
overlap rejection and a kernel balanced-theft regression; the compiler
refuses protocol-claimed ordinary-L-BTC scopes with a typed error and both
pilot analyzed projections were verified byte-identical; the complete
analyzed-program validator runs on the construction path with the execution
report validated; projections compare exactly and duplicate-sensitively;
the coverage graph uses one enabler-toward-dependent orientation with
endpoint classes checked on insertion; exact-search counters are checked
before increment.

Target foundation: 38 opcodes reviewed against upstream Elements source
with review provenance recorded in the target reference and excluded from
the semantic projection; the tapscript leaf version is the reviewed 0xc4;
arithmetic failure retains operands and pushes false; asset and value
introspection push payload and prefix separately; 27 encoding classes,
37 capabilities, and 20 evidence requirements validate with mutation and
permutation coverage; sighash dimensions are recorded unreviewed and
commitment equality and authenticated opening remain unsupported; the
development binding rejects production, zero identifiers, and version
mismatch and carries no credential field. The compiler exposes
RequiredCapability with a complete census and a read-only requirement set
constructible only from fully validated analysis; the adapter classifies
all thirteen capabilities exhaustively with an independent oracle, the
authorization rows block on the unreviewed sighash dimensions, and the
complete-backend-pattern claim is unconstructible by type.

Gate evidence, all on the merged batch tree: ci.sh eleven lanes green
under the pinned SDK toolchain with the advisory lane RUNNING through an
isolated cargo-audit shim (149 crates scanned, no advisories) and the
mocked Meson contract required; canonical meson compile and test 10/10;
the workspace suite green across 46 test binaries; document byte
reproducibility not required this batch because no paper input changed
(the one-line realization-document correction is covered by the label and
weld lanes). Toolchain note: the SDK extension bundles clippy 0.1.88
against a 1.99-nightly cargo, and the current upstream clippy 0.1.99 adds
an assert-is-empty lint; its machine-applicable rewrites were adopted, and
roughly ninety non-machine-applicable test assertion sites remain OPEN as
drift work for when the lint reaches a supported gate toolchain.

Identity impact: Layer-0 version, architecture schema and hashes, and
generated publications unchanged; no target, deployment, compiler, or
report digest minted; Cargo.lock gained exactly the two first-party
package stanzas; no third-party dependency entered.

### 2.13 Guide-9 target-native gate · `gate:backlog:guide9`

The Guide-9 batch closed the fourth-review register (§5.4, all eleven
rows), made the target contract sound, and delivered the typed instruction
core with development target-native primitive evidence. Starting revision
88d0661; batch branch merged fast-forward after this record.

Contract soundness: a reviewed-Elements trust state distinct from generic
validation, constructible only by the first-party derivation or exact
typed equality; a typed success algebra with retained operands and
condition-discriminated alternatives re-reviewed against upstream with
line provenance; six cross-subcontract welds; transitive capability-status
closure under an explicit strength order; package-owned encoding
interpretation; a reviewed literal-push contract whose minimality cascade
is ordered data and whose relay-versus-consensus enforcement is typed; a
five-byte timelock operand class making the sequence disable flag
stateable. Identity and publication repairs: the draft and release
validators return the only wrappers accepted by the public architecture
identity functions with published values proven unmoved; publication
freshness now includes the required mode with in-place mode-only repair;
ADR-016 records the bounded grandfathered-recipe exception.

Instruction core and adapter: typed instructions, checked stack items,
canonical minimal-push serialization, a strict supported-subset parser
with round-trip equality, and an abstract stack validator carrying every
success alternative and all three failure shapes under checked work
limits, agreeing with an independent bounded oracle; the static adapter
consumes only the reviewed contract and answers both compiler censuses
with exhaustive matches and both-direction exact equality.

Native evidence: a secretless conformance harness with a lock-step
protocol that fails closed on every malformation and types mock runs as
unable to satisfy the gate; a 398-case fixture census whose expectations
come from the typed contract and independent published vectors; a
first-party executor adapter driving a disposable wallet-free
elementsregtest node, judging consensus fixtures by block validation and
relay fixtures by mempool acceptance, with an explicit reason-string
mapping that leaves target-collapsed causes coarse rather than guessed.
The run: 398 of 398 cases passed, 18 of 18 required evidence rows, zero
infrastructure errors, report bytes identical across fresh-node runs and
the build lane; triage attributed and repaired every first-contact
divergence in its owning module, including a transcription error in a
published signature vector that only real verification exposed. Executor
provenance: Elements Core v28.99.0-6f43e3ffe730, rebuilt from a clean
tree at the reviewed revision after an earlier stale binary predating the
elliptic-curve stack-size fix was refused for evidence; synthetic
development identifiers 32x09 and 32x07.

Gate evidence on the merged tree: ci.sh eleven lanes green under the
pinned SDK toolchain with the advisory lane running through the isolated
shim and the mocked Meson contract required; canonical meson compile and
test eleven of eleven; the native lane on the batch tip with the stamp
produced; document byte reproducibility not required because no paper
input changed. Honest bounds: sighash semantics remain unresolved by
design, commitment equality and authenticated opening remain unsupported,
confidential-value conservation remains transaction-level evidence, the
report completeness is partial-unresolved-remains, and the Guide-9
concept text stays in the session archive because carrying it breached
the plan-tree hard byte cap.

Identity impact: Layer-0 version, architecture schema and hashes, and
generated publications unchanged; no digest of any kind minted; the
conformance package is the only Cargo.lock addition; no new third-party
dependency beyond workspace-existing crates plus a test-only PTY helper.

---

### The verification harness's two standing hazards · `rem:backlog:verification-harness`

A verdict is read from the report wrapper's own report line, never from a pipeline's shell status: the wrapper propagates its exit code faithfully, and a pipe to a filter truncates the status to the last stage's. And a single shared build-target directory is poisoned when checkouts of two different commits build the same crates into it, so a lane that moves between commits pins a target directory of its own.

### Publication metadata · `rem:backlog:publication-metadata`

The published documents carry their attribution and their terms: the attribution position names Proof Commons, a commons rather than a company, and the document set is dedicated to the public domain. A specification exists to be reproduced, cited and implemented, and an attribution condition taxes exactly that use, so the attribution that matters is the one the title page carries. The rights line states the dedication, the licence-URL field names the canonical deed for machine readers, and the document licence file holds the legal code verbatim.

### The crates carry the product's name · `rem:backlog:crate-naming`

Each crate manifest and the build system's project name the product, so the product the repository describes is the product its artifacts are named after. The name feeds nothing that hashes, exports or gates: the versioning derivation reads the version alone, the binary and library target names are their own, and the generated model artifacts never carried it.

### The realization's fixed body states its law · `rem:backlog:law-delimitation`

The realization's fixed body states the law without restating the era. The versioning law leaves its worked example to the masthead, which prints the live binding; the hash pins defer to the algorithm the attached envelope names; and the schema discriminants are read at their carriers — the envelope for the architecture manifest, the canonical query context for the wire, the bound profile for deployment. The workspace authors field names the publishing organization.

### The shared crate's acknowledgement · `rem:backlog:cli-common-thanks`

The shared command-line crate's README thanks the developers whose work inspired the tooling. Gratitude for inspiration, stated once, naming no repository and claiming no lineage: the crate's own manual remains the authority on what it does.

### The tip's tests assert their own consistency · `rem:backlog:tip-convergence`

The release profile's identity test derives its expected value from the profile itself rather than comparing against a hand-pinned constant, so the tree asserts its own internal consistency instead of a value a reader would have to take on trust. The paper is Attestation, the product is Tripod, and the protocol object is the attestation contract.

### The licence terms and their citation families · `rem:backlog:licence-convergence`

The code licence is stated once, in the licence file, and the manifest key, the toolchain licence rule and the dependency comments agree with it rather than restating it a second way. The dependency-review clauses name what a dropped feature pulled in and which rule refuses it, which holds under any workspace licence, and the toolchain record says why a copyleft workspace strengthens rather than relaxes the permissive-dependency rule. Documents stay under the public-domain dedication.

### The hash-citation audit the lint suite runs · `rem:backlog:hash-citation-audit`

The audit holds every published hexadecimal value to the identity rule, as a labels binary in the lint suite wired exactly as the forbidden-text check is: it asks git for the complete tracked set and requires every value to be described by a rule in the citation-families table, which names what each kind of value measures and the program that writes it. The audit places rather than recomputes — whether a digest is right belongs to the test that owns it — and what it establishes is that every value has an owner on the record.

### The cut the settled records carry · `rem:backlog:record-cut`

A planning record earns its place by what it establishes, so the passages that spent themselves on a document's own corrections are gone and what survives argues the result. A citation is a promise that a reader can fetch what it names, so the sites that cited tags no hub carries name the phase cards and the archived record as the durable record, with nothing hash-shaped substituted. The archive index states its rule for when a settled record may be edited at all, and states it there rather than here: a wave record that paraphrases a rule it does not own carries a second copy of it, and the copy stops being true the moment the rule is sharpened.

### The discipline every published value follows · `rem:backlog:hash-citation-discipline`

Every hexadecimal value the tree publishes declares how a reader establishes it: recomputable from bytes the tree carries under a named algorithm, resolvable to a referent a reader can fetch, or defined by something other than its author. A value that nothing regenerates, nothing resolves and nothing defines stands nowhere, including inside an encoded rendering, which a decode-and-assert check reads. The cascade above the captures recomputes from the bytes it is taken over, and each chosen constant is a derivation from a string published beside it.

### The separators spell the product's name · `rem:backlog:separator-convergence`

A domain separator is hashed input that identifies a recipe, and the product's name is part of that identity. Each separator spells it at the version it carries, because no projection, encoding or algorithm moved. The identities that follow those bytes are re-taken by the tree's own generator rather than edited, so the typed pin, the generated artifacts, the realization's envelope and the versioning gate carry one result.

### 3.2 Current published identities · `tbl:backlog:identities`

Exact hash and version values are deliberately not duplicated here. Read each
identity from its authority:

| Identity | Authority |
|---|---|
| Specification version | `papers/attestation/main.tex` and `sections/00_title.tex` |
| Architecture schema, semantic/behavioural algorithms and hashes, anchor-set hash | `packages/model/generated/architecture.json`, checked against typed architecture |
| Realization version (tracked binding) | `docs/attestation/realization.md` masthead |
| Attestation wire schema | typed model/architecture constants |
| Deployment-profile schema | typed architecture constants |

The generated architecture publication is authoritative. Planning prose must
not become a competing identity source.

Architecture finality does not imply:

- complete realization scope;
- compiler completeness;
- target support;
- linked bundle or ABI existence;
- deployment evidence;
- production readiness.

## 5. Current static-review findings · `sec:backlog:findings`

### 5.1 Summary · `tbl:backlog:findings-current`

| ID | Priority | Status | Finding |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `T6` | P1 | DONE | External-evidence relations bypassed abstract capability validation during proof planning. |
| `T7` | P1 | DONE | Representation-relation proof choices were not constrained by the selected representation mode. |
| `T8` | P2 | DONE | Current-phase declarations disagreed and the plan checker did not detect all copies. |
| `T9` | P2 | DONE | Compiler status documentation materially understated implemented internal analysis. |

All four findings were reproduced or directly corrected, repaired, and
verified in the Guide-4 batch; the gate record is in §2.8. Their evidence
records follow. Implementation detail beyond these records belongs to Git
history. The later two-pass review recorded in §2.1 opened the SR2 findings
in §5.2.

### 5.2 Second-review findings · `tbl:backlog:findings-sr2`

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SR2-01` | High | DONE | CI could report green without the tracked-entry mode audit; lint alias and mocked contract omitted census-audit. |
| `SR2-02` | Medium | DONE | Root-use policy was reused as the observed root effect, rejecting valid succession under succession-or-termination. |
| `SR2-03` | Medium | DONE | Lifecycle relations and lifecycle graph declarations were not bidirectionally welded. |
| `SR2-04` | Medium | DONE | Placement validation accepted noncanonical, duplicate, and surplus-layout assignments. |
| `SR2-05` | Medium | DONE | Placed proof-plan validation did not compare the exact offered and placed sets. |
| `SR2-06` | Medium | DONE | Public deployment-profile hashing accepted unvalidated profiles; hashing now requires the validated wrapper and the identity stays dormant. |
| `SR2-07` | Medium | DONE | Open-flow observation normalization did not enforce reference sides, cross-flow uniqueness, or anchor exclusion. |
| `SR2-08` | Low | DONE | Representation-conditional activation was keyed by mode only; it is now keyed by object and mode. |
| `SR2-09` | Low | DONE | Coverage shape validation was weaker than derivation; the analyzed-program validator compares exact independently re-derived coverage projections in both directions, gate record §2.11. |
| `SR2-10` | Low | DONE | Compiler package-index status and review provenance had drifted; both reconciled. |
| `SR2-H1` | Hardening | DONE | Tempfile publication can replace generated files with owner-only permissions; closed by the SR3-04 repair in the Guide-8 preflight wave. |
| `SR2-H2` | Hardening | DONE | Dirty-tree document-reproducibility probe skips with exit 0; closed by the SR3-06 repair in the Guide-8 preflight wave. |

The DONE rows were repaired in the Guide-7 preflight wave with focused tests
and the working debug lane; the batch full gate is recorded with the Guide-7
exit record. Open-flow complete partitioning deliberately remains a
sponsor-isolation relation verdict rather than observation parsing, so an
unclaimed member stays an evaluable semantic failure. The two hardening rows
were parked with explicit activation conditions; the third review re-raised
both, which satisfies those conditions, so they are active again and tracked
with the §5.3 register.

### 5.3 Third-review findings · `tbl:backlog:findings-sr3`

The third static review reported two passes over the tree recorded in §2.1.
First-pass findings carry SR3 identifiers; second-pass findings retain the
review's S2 identifiers.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SR3-01` | High | DONE | A malformed same-owner citation whose one-sided parenthesis test is suppressed by an unrelated parenthesis elsewhere on the line falls back to a bare occurrence and silently mints the label. Citations now classify by their immediate parenthesized group with a focused malformed-group diagnostic in both parsers; the previously test-locked vulnerable assertion was inverted; a corpus scan showed zero live classification changes. |
| `SR3-02` | Medium | DONE | Census filesystem traversal suppresses read-dir and entry errors, so an unreadable tree with an empty declared group can verify as an empty census. Traversal failures are now typed census-unreadable diagnostics consumed by verification, with unreadable-directory, failed-entry, and scoped-derivation regressions; container-nested fences are additionally rejected. |
| `SR3-03` | Medium | DONE | The complete analyzed-program validator is not on the production construction path; the constructor runs only the narrow assembly-closure check. The constructor now runs the complete fresh re-derivation validator, and the execution report is validated rather than excluded; the measured pilot construction cost stays seconds-scale. |
| `SR3-04` | Medium | DONE | Atomic publication staging leaves published public files with owner-only tempfile permissions; supersedes the parked SR2-H1. A typed publication-mode helper now sets 0644 or 0755 on the staged file before rename in batch publication, report writing, and the shell sync path, with absent, changed, and unchanged destination mode tests. |
| `SR3-05` | Medium | DONE | Git-derived checker census arguments are expanded unquoted, so an unusual tracked path can split or alter checker argv. A shared census-argument library now emits shell-quoted role-tagged argv re-read as quoted words, fails closed on an empty census, and a loud preflight audit rejects tracked paths outside a safe grammar; derived argv verified byte-identical on the live tree. |
| `SR3-06` | Medium | DONE | The document-reproducibility gate exits 0 after skipping its reused-build epoch probe on a dirty tree; supersedes the parked SR2-H2. The gate now fails a dirty tree by default, reserves exit 0 for both advertised checks passing, and reports an explicit partial status under an opt-in flag; fixing it exposed and repaired a signing-config defect that had prevented the epoch probe from ever running here. |
| `SR3-07` | Low | DONE | Proof-search rejection statistics count source and constructibility failures as capability rejections. Local feasibility now returns a typed rejection reason with a matching counter per cause; repairing it exposed a miscounted source-derivation branch and a counter with no increment site, both corrected. |
| `SR3-08` | Low | DONE | The package index still says complete analyzed pilots are open, contradicting the recorded Guide-7 state. The index row now states the implemented-internally claim with the public boundary and target adapter absent. |
| `S2-01` | High | DONE | Sponsor erasure is keyed to the ordinary L-BTC object family instead of fee-sponsor flow membership, erasing protocol-role amounts that future operations must read. The model and realization layers derive the sponsor region from exact fee-sponsor flow membership with two-point overlap rejection, protocol-role readability, and a kernel balanced-theft regression; the compiler derives a three-valued flow role from the declared open flows and refuses protocol-claimed ordinary L-BTC scopes with a typed error, so the remaining family-shaped guards rest on an enforced gate whose lifting condition is documented at each use; both pilot analyzed projections were verified byte-identical. |
| `S2-03` | Medium | DONE | The coverage dependency graph mixes opposite edge orientations against its documented prerequisite-to-dependent convention. All edges are normalized to enabler-toward-dependent with declared endpoint classes checked on insertion; a reversed prerequisite edge between same-class endpoints remains caught by census comparison, and that limit is stated. |
| `S2-04` | Medium | DONE | Analyzed-program coverage-graph validation compares sets rather than exact projections, silently accepting duplicated nodes and edges. Stored and required projections now compare exactly with duplicate, order, and length-preserving corruption regressions. |
| `S2-05` | Low | DONE | Exact-search counters use unchecked addition and can overflow instead of returning the promised typed complexity failure. A checked counter module tests the limit before incrementing under an inclusive root-counted rule, diagnostic counters saturate, and boundary regressions pin a budget of one, exact-limit completion, and limit-plus-one. |
| `S2-06` | Low | DONE | The paper subproject declares C as a project language with no C target, requiring an undocumented compiler. The language declaration is removed; setup no longer probes a C toolchain and the mocked contract passes. |
| `S2-07` | Low | DONE | Compiler planning status remains stale and a resolved factorization question is still listed as open, although the drift finding was marked closed. The resolved per-operation-factor decision is now recorded as a rule and removed from the open questions; the genuinely open boundary, ownership, objective, and identity questions remain. |

The Guide-8 preflight wave owned SR3-01 through SR3-08 and S2-01 through
S2-07; all were closed before the compiler target-requirement boundary
became public, gate record §2.12.

### 5.4 Fourth-review findings · `tbl:backlog:findings-r2`

The fourth static review reported two passes over the tree recorded in §2.1.
Reconfirmed first-pass findings carry R2-C identifiers; second-pass additions
carry R2-N identifiers. The Guide-9 preflight owns the register; the review
ranks the target-contract rows as Phase-3 blockers before the typed
instruction core consumes the contracts.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| `R2-C01` | High | DONE | The opcode stack contract carries one success result sequence, so primitives with alternative valid success shapes, retained operands, or discriminated encodings cannot be represented. A typed success algebra now carries fixed, retained-operand, and condition-discriminated cases re-reviewed against the upstream interpreter with recorded line provenance; the retained timelock operand, issuance push order, and independently confidential issuance amounts are all representable, and the timelock contradiction with its resource row is repaired. |
| `R2-C02` | High | DONE | Redundant target subcontracts are only locally validated; signature, timelock, issuance, confidential-value, resource, and evidence views can contradict one another inside one validated definition. Six weld validators now require cross-view agreement with focused globally-contradictory mutation coverage and a welded-reviewed-contract control. |
| `R2-C03` | High | DONE | Capability assessment reads only direct primitive statuses, so a reviewed capability whose transitive prerequisite is unsupported still assesses as usable. Statuses now compose under an explicit strength order and a capability may not exceed its weakest transitive prerequisite; the reviewed registry verified closure-coherent with no downgrades, and the target validator rejects violations with the offending edge named. |
| `R2-C04` | Medium | DONE | Encoding numericity is derived from byte-order presence, making the byte-order validation circular and letting a numeric class validate without any order. Interpretation is now an exhaustive package-owned match over the encoding class with independent V1 shape expectations, making the missing and spurious byte-order rejections genuinely reachable. |
| `R2-C05` | Medium | DONE | The adapter consumes only the capability census and drops the compiler's external-evidence-role census, so a new role can disappear without adapter work. The assessment set now carries both censuses with exhaustive role matching, both-direction exact equality, typed duplicate and mismatch rejections, and an independent evidence-role oracle. |
| `R2-C06` | Medium | DONE | The active architecture semantic hash predates the domain-separated identity recipe; the exception or migration must be explicit, never a silent prefix change. ADR-016 now records a bounded grandfathered-recipe rule for the architecture semantic and anchor-set hashes, welded into the identity table; future identities keep the domain-separated form. |
| `R2-C07` | Low | DONE | The package index still marks the implemented target packages as planned, and the root README layout omits the current package set; paper end-marker comment drift is noted but deferred with the paper-edit obligations. The index rows and the root layout now state the active honest claims; the paper end-marker fixes remain deferred to the next deliberate paper edit. |
| `R2-N01` | High | DONE | A caller-assembled target definition can acquire the same validated wrapper as the built-in reviewed Elements definition, so the reviewed trust state is caller-assertable. A distinct reviewed-Elements wrapper is now constructible only by the first-party derivation or by exact typed equality with it; mutated-but-coherent definitions stay generic under public-API tests. |
| `R2-N02` | Medium | DONE | The adapter accepts a combined target-and-binding value but ignores the deployment half entirely, so assessments are invariant under activation, network, and resource-override differences. The assessment API now consumes the reviewed static definition and is named static; the combined value is no longer named anywhere in the adapter crate, and deployment-aware assessment remains deliberately deferred until a real consumer exists. |
| `R2-N03` | Medium | DONE | Public architecture identity functions accept unvalidated architecture values, so an invalid architecture can bear the active semantic hash recipe. The draft and release validators now return borrowing validated wrappers that are the only public path to the identity and publication functions; unchecked projections are crate-private for mutation tests, and an equivalence test plus the pinned gates prove no published identity moved. |
| `R2-N04` | Medium | DONE | Compare-if-changed publication checks bytes only, so mode-only corruption survives indefinitely, including a synced helper binary that lost its executable bit. Destination freshness now means bytes and required mode; mode-only mismatches are repaired in place without rewriting bytes, the repair is visible in the typed result, both sync scripts repair equal-byte destinations, and a mock-toolchain shell test runs the full matrix. |

### 5.5 Fifth-review findings · `tbl:backlog:findings-sr5`

The fifth static review reported two passes over the tree recorded in §2.1.
The second pass consolidates the first: first-pass identifiers R5-01 through
R5-07 map into the SR5 register as SR5-01, SR5-02, SR5-03, SR5-06, SR5-08,
SR5-12, and SR5-13 respectively; the remaining SR5 rows are second-pass
additions. The Guide-10 preflight waves own the register; the review ranks
the native-evidence rows and the signature abstraction as blockers before
Guide-10 prototype evidence may be recorded (guide §2.1).

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SR5-01` | High | ACTIVE | The public native-report gate validates only required evidence rows that happen to be present; an empty, row-deleted, or relabeled report census passes. Required repair: complete owner validation returning a validated report wrapper with exact duplicate-sensitive case and evidence-row censuses and recomputed statuses, dispositions, and summary. |
| `SR5-02` | High | ACTIVE | Broad evidence rows pass when only a subset of their semantic claim has cases: issuance-absent cases complete issuance introspection, rejection-only signature cases complete signature semantics, explicit-form cases complete confidential encodings, and consensus resource cases complete relay-policy resource evidence. Required repair: typed claim-level evidence census beneath the broad requirement identifiers with exact required-claim coverage. |
| `SR5-03` | High | ACTIVE | Native reports retain only the case ordinal, expected outcome, observed outcome, and status, omitting the exact script, stack, context, enforcement layer, leaf version, and expected resources; two fixture sets can produce indistinguishable reports. Required repair: complete canonical fixture projection embedded in each report row. |
| `SR5-04` | High | ACTIVE | A development binding validated against one target definition can later combine with a different definition of the same contract version, because the binding retains only the version. Required repair: retain the validated target projection in the binding or introduce a reviewed-development-binding wrapper constructible only against the reviewed Elements definition. |
| `SR5-05` | High | ACTIVE | The static signature model cannot represent the target's documented empty-signature and unknown-public-key-type behavior: exact-width operand types reject the empty form before the failure contract applies and exclude the succeeds-without-verification path. Required repair: operand alternatives with conditional failure semantics, plus native unknown-key vectors before signature evidence is complete. |
| `SR5-06` | Medium | ACTIVE | Reported network and genesis identifiers are caller declarations copied through the pipeline; the executor never reports what chain it actually ran, and the recorded synthetic identifiers confirm the fields are run labels. Required repair: a typed executor environment observation compared against the validated binding before any case executes. |
| `SR5-07` | Medium | ACTIVE | Relation identifiers are not generically welded to relation bodies; the kind vocabulary contains an unused member and lacks a member for expression predicates. Required repair: an exhaustive relation-identity validator deriving expected kind and subject from every body variant, with the kind vocabulary corrected. |
| `SR5-08` | Medium | ACTIVE | Native executor provenance cannot express the executed tip, upstream base, and local-topic census that ADR-018 requires, and a checkout-HEAD fallback can misattribute a binary's revision. Required repair: separated adapter, node, and integration-provenance fields with no checkout fallback into the binary-reported revision. |
| `SR5-09` | Medium | ACTIVE | Executor timeout kills only the immediate child, so a real adapter's node, temporary datadir, cookie, and inherited pipes can outlive the run. Required repair: process-group supervision with graceful-then-forced group termination and a descendant-retaining regression test. |
| `SR5-10` | Medium | ACTIVE | Executor protocol lines are read into an unbounded buffer, so one unterminated line can exhaust memory before typed rejection. Required repair: explicit per-phase protocol record limits enforced with bounded reads. |
| `SR5-11` | Medium | ACTIVE | Schema-2 deployment profiles can acquire a type named validated deployment release despite the documented production-blocking ABI gap. Required repair: split structural profile validity from production-release validity, with the latter unconstructible under schema 2. |
| `SR5-12` | Low | ACTIVE | Blank protocol lines and trailing blank data are silently accepted despite the documented fail-closed protocol. Required repair: strict NDJSON framing with blank and trailing records rejected. |
| `SR5-13` | Low | ACTIVE | Public status documentation is stale: the root README denies the instruction core and omits the conformance package, and the target package still claims no native evidence exists. Required repair: reconcile the statements with the package-boundary claim that the static crate owns requirements while development native evidence lives in the conformance package. |

The review also recorded three lower-severity observations to close alongside
the owning repairs: accepted responses are not protocol-shape validated
against the advertised handshake capabilities, public fixture construction
does little semantic context validation, and the Python adapter tolerates an
empty context script path where the fixture script is nonempty.

### T6 — Validate capabilities for external-evidence obligations · `task:review:external-evidence-capability`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE

Reproduction: with every capability available except whole-transaction value
conservation, production planning returned feasible plans for both pilots
(two compact-ASH and four live-transfer candidates) that carried the
substrate-conservation evidence requirement while omitting the conservation
capability entirely.

Repair: the external-evidence obligation class now retains its approved proof
alternative, required capabilities, and source requirements. Classification
validates that the realization approves exactly one substrate-conservation
alternative, with a typed error for any other shape. Enumeration tests the
fixed capability set against the capability view before the search begins and
seeds every candidate from the fixed requirements. The evidence requirement
remains unresolved, and no sponsor amount enters any fixed requirement.

Focused tests, in the compiler proof suite:

- `a_missing_whole_transaction_capability_blocks_substrate_conservation`
- `adding_the_whole_transaction_capability_restores_feasibility`
- `external_evidence_carries_its_capability_and_source_into_every_candidate`
- `fixed_external_requirements_name_no_sponsor_amount`
- `an_unexpected_external_evidence_alternative_is_rejected`

### T7 — Constrain every representation-sensitive proof choice · `task:review:representation-proof-compatibility`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE

Reproduction: unconstrained live-transfer planning returned four candidates,
two of which paired a selected mode with a contradictory arithmetic proof on
the representation relation itself (private committed with public arithmetic,
and explicit with confidential conservation).

Repair: representation relations are declared relation-only in both pilot
declarations, with the approved mode sets unchanged, and the compiler
classifies them as statically validated alongside lifecycle exits. The
conservation relation keeps exact proof/mode compatibility. Live transfer now
yields exactly one candidate per approved mode, and the selected mode remains
in each candidate's representations for later placement and backend work.

Focused tests, in the compiler proof suite:

- `representation_relations_carry_no_proof_variable`
- `live_transfer_conservation_agrees_with_every_selected_mode`
- `compact_ash_keeps_both_modes_under_public_arithmetic`
- `every_pilot_relation_is_classified_exactly_once`, extended

The independent oracle no longer calls production obligation classification.
It derives the substrate-conservation capability and its typed external
source row itself, creates no proof variable for representation relations,
and validates fixed requirements before enumeration. New oracle regressions
cover the missing whole-transaction capability across all scopes, one
candidate per live mode, and random capability views over all thirteen
capabilities, while still distinguishing infeasibility from unexpected
errors.

### T8 — Weld every current-phase declaration · `task:review:phase-declaration-drift`

**Priority:** P2
**Status:** DONE

Repair: the plans README declares Phase 2 in the fixed declaration form. The
plan checker now compares the backlog current gate, the roadmap current
phase, the plans README current phase, and exactly one active numbered phase
card, normalized to the numeric phase. Diagnostics are order-stable and name
the stale file, the observed phase, and the expected phase; malformed or
missing declarations fail explicitly.

Focused tests: ten phase-weld tests in the labels plans module covering
agreement, each stale copy, zero and two active cards, malformed and missing
declarations, a gate without a phase card, and traversal-order independence.

### T9 — Refresh compiler status documentation · `task:review:compiler-status-drift`

**Priority:** P2
**Status:** DONE

Repair: the compiler crate Rustdoc lists the implemented internal stages and
the remaining absent work, and keeps the boundary statement that no public
value can be mistaken for a completed analysis. The compiler package
contract and the packages index carry an accurate status and milestone
states, and the phase card separates delivered-analysis requirements from
the open placement, coverage, and pilot deliverables. The stale-phrase sweep
found two current-state matches; both were corrected.

Verification: compiler package tests, a warning-free Rustdoc build, and the
plans check all passed.

### 6.2 Completed foundation

The following are implemented internally and remain subject to their package
tests and owner validation:

```text
P2-001  realization boundary
P2-002  Petgraph review
P2-003  compiler crate and error root
P2-004  compiler input binding
P2-005  relation/expression DAGs
P2-006  checked constant folding
P2-007  exact proof planning, reaccepted
P2-008  source, constructibility, and disclosure analysis
P2-009  representation lifecycle
P2-010  execution-case placement and layout requirements
P2-011  relation-indexed coverage requirements
```

No complete analyzed-program public API is exposed yet. This is deliberate:
partial analyses must not be mistaken for a completed compiler result.

### P2-007 — Repair and reaccept exact proof planning · `task:phase2:proof-planning`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** T6, T7, P2-005, P2-006
**Blocks:** P2-010 through P2-013

Reaccepted after T6 and T7 closed; the gate record is in §2.8.

Reacceptance required, and the recorded evidence establishes:

1. every in-scope relation classified exactly once;
2. every approved proof alternative retained or rejected for a typed reason;
3. external-evidence capabilities validated;
4. proof/representation compatibility applied completely;
5. capability and source requirements consistent;
6. hard constraints applied before objective or candidate retention;
7. exact feasible set compared with an independently derived exhaustive oracle;
8. no partial result on complexity exhaustion;
9. deterministic candidate ordering and equality under declaration
   permutations.

The search retains the exact feasible set; it does not silently select one
candidate under an unstated target policy.

### P2-010 — Derive execution-case placement and layout requirements · `task:phase2:placement`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** accepted P2-007, P2-008, P2-009, C1-009
**Blocks:** P2-011 and P2-012

Delivered in the Guide-5 batch; the gate record and evidence are in §2.9.

Relations are classified per execution case on independent axes — discharge
boundary, semantic scope, activation, and carrier multiplicity — rather than
one local/global/conditional/duplicated category. Execution cases expand only
the sponsor dimension; the representation is fixed by each feasible proof
plan. Every active runtime relation case has an eligible abstract carrier;
carrier eligibility, exact feasible placement sets, and target-independent
layout requirements are validated against an independent exhaustive oracle.
Complexity limits are explicit typed parameters and exhaustion returns no
partial result. No target bytes or concrete target positions enter this
stage.

### P2-011 — Derive relation-indexed coverage requirements · `task:phase2:coverage`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** P2-010, C1-010, C1-013
**Blocks:** P2-012

Delivered in the Guide-6 batch; the gate record and evidence are in §2.10.

Exact equality holds among the realization relation scope, the compiler
relation scope, the relation-case plan scope, and the coverage scope. Every
active relation-case carries positive and negative requirements at each of
its boundaries, a carrier requirement when runtime-carried, and an accepted
semantic-projection requirement; inactive relation-cases carry an explicit
inactive-valid requirement; conditional relations satisfy the
inactive-valid, active-valid, active-invalid triplet across the case set,
and representation modes are covered across the complete feasible plan
set. A broad operation test does not substitute for relation coverage.

### P2-012 — Analyze both pilots end to end · `task:phase2:pilots`

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** T6, T7, P2-005 through P2-011
**Blocks:** P2-013

Delivered in the Guide-7 batch; the gate record and evidence are in §2.11.

Both pilots analyze end to end into one validated scoped analyzed program
per scope: the acceptance relation lists are the exact relation censuses,
every requirement in the acceptance matrices holds, rejected proof and
representation pairings are absent from the plan set, repeated analysis
from equal typed inputs produces equal stable projections, and the
combined two-pilot scope stores per-operation factors whose product
equals the retired global enumeration exactly. The analyzed value claims
no deployment lifecycle completeness: the pilots retain their future
target and operation obligations explicitly.

### P2-013 — Phase-2 evidence and exit · `gate:backlog:phase2`

**Priority:** Gate
**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** T6–T9, P2-004 through P2-012, C1-005, C1-008,
C1-009, C1-010, C1-013

Passed; the complete exit evidence is the Guide-7 gate record in §2.11,
including the declared-MSRV and current-stable lanes, the meson-required
CI run, the explicit product regressions, and passed document byte
reproducibility. Every exit condition held: findings closed, censuses
exact, capabilities failing closed, deterministic pilot analysis,
independent oracles agreeing, gates recorded, current-phase declarations
moving together, and a clean final tree.

Phase completion does not itself justify a persistent compiler digest;
none was minted.

## 7. Immediate algorithm preparation · `sec:backlog:algorithms`

### 7.1 Current status · `tbl:backlog:algorithms`

### 7.2 C1-008 — Proof-plan search reacceptance

Reaccepted in the Guide-4 batch, gate record §2.8. The recorded evidence
establishes each former condition:

- external-evidence capability requirements are retained;
- representation-sensitive proofs are checked against selected modes;
- candidate capabilities and sources agree;
- the independent oracle derives those rules independently;
- infeasibility and complexity exhaustion remain distinct;
- no partial result is returned.

### 7.3 C1-009 — Execution-case-aware placement

Delivered in the Guide-5 batch with P2-010; the gate record is in §2.9.
Every active relation case is covered by an eligible carrier, production
search is compared with an independent exhaustive assignment oracle on
small instances and both pilot scopes, and the adversarial case list —
optional-carrier defects, global-on-local defects, source unavailability,
duplicate enforcement, permutation equality, and both budget exhaustions —
is retained as focused regressions.

### 7.4 C1-010 — Typed symbols and SCC policy

Delivered in the Guide-6 batch within the coverage scope; the gate record is
in §2.10. Two-pass typed resolution runs a complete definition census before
complete reference resolution; duplicate keys, unknown references, and
cross-operation references fail; SCC members and diagnostics are normalized
by stable key and every current cycle is rejected. SCC membership does not
authorize a semantic cycle — an accepted cycle would require a new typed
resolution strategy and policy review. This work prepares linker policy but
pulled no linker or target types into compiler core.

### 7.5 C1-013 — Independent algorithm oracles

| Production analysis | Independent oracle |
|---|---|
| canonical topology | valid-order enumeration plus least-key rule |
| SCC | mutual-reachability equivalence |
| expression interning | non-interned evaluator |
| dependency closure | repeated complete scan |
| proof selection | exhaustive candidate enumeration with independently derived hard constraints |
| placement | exhaustive carrier subsets |
| relation census | direct set equality |
| constant folding | non-folded evaluator |
| stable projection | declaration-order permutation |
| coverage | direct relation × case matrix equality |

The proof-selection oracle must not call the same obligation-classification or
compatibility helper as production for the property it is meant to verify.

Delivered across the Guide-5 and Guide-6 batches: the placement oracle in
§2.9; the relation-by-case coverage oracle, the repeated-scan collateral
oracle, and the mutual-reachability SCC oracle in §2.10. Each restates its
hard predicates independently of the production helper it verifies.

## 8. Dependency posture · `sec:backlog:dependencies`

### 8.1 Current and deferred dependencies · `tbl:backlog:dependencies`

| Dependency | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `petgraph = 0.8.3` | Adopted and reviewed; `serde-1` only | Graph storage and standard algorithms |
| `num-bigint` | Existing | Exact arbitrary-size integers |
| `num-integer` | Existing | Exact integer helpers |
| `num-traits` | Existing | Numeric traits |
| `proptest` | Existing | Property and independent-oracle testing |
| `num-rational` | Deferred | Future exact-rational consumer |
| `faer` | Deferred | Future certified numerical diagnostics |
| `fixedbitset` | Deferred | Dense local coverage sets if measured |
| Elements libraries | Phase-3 review | Target transaction and consensus types |
| SAT/LP/MILP solver | Deferred | Larger exact planning only after measured need |
| `salsa` | Deferred | Incremental compiler queries |
| `egg` | Deferred | Equality saturation |
| `rayon` | Removed and deferred | Requires measured need and schedule-independent results |

The latest static review excluded `Cargo.lock`; no lockfile claim is made by
that review.

### 8.2 Dependency-entry rule · `rule:backlog:dependency-entry`

A deferred dependency enters only when:

1. a concrete consumer exists;
2. current implementation demonstrates missing functionality;
3. simpler exact first-party code is insufficient;
4. source, version, licence, MSRV, unsafe boundary, transitive graph,
   determinism, and advisories are reviewed;
5. public API leakage is considered;
6. focused tests and an independent oracle exist;
7. lockfile changes are reviewed;
8. required gates remain green and clean.

Unused dependencies are not added to advertise intent.

---

## 9. Mathematical and algorithmic laws · `sec:backlog:laws`

### 9.1 Exactness · `rule:backlog:exactness`

Semantic, conservation, authorization, identity, calibration, and release
claims use:

- checked bounded integers;
- arbitrary-precision integers;
- reduced exact rationals;
- exact finite search;
- independently checked certificates;
- target-native execution where the claim concerns the target.

A floating residual is diagnostic evidence, not exact equality.

### 9.2 Handles and identity · `rule:backlog:handles`

Always distinguish:

```text
local handle:
    process-local graph, arena, matrix, or solver position

stable key:
    complete typed semantic identity

digest:
    optional domain-separated commitment admitted under ADR-016
```

Never use as semantic identity:

- Petgraph indices;
- matrix positions;
- solver variable numbers;
- insertion or traversal order;
- source path or line;
- pivot order;
- floating-point bits;
- thread schedule;
- temporary path.

### 9.3 Complexity failure · `rule:backlog:complexity`

An analysis exceeding its explicit budget returns a typed complexity error.

It must not:

- drop a relation;
- weaken authorization;
- increase disclosure silently;
- remove a lifecycle exit;
- switch to an undocumented greedy fallback;
- claim optimality from incomplete search;
- accept the best partial result seen before exhaustion.

### 9.4 Evidence separation · `rule:backlog:evidence-separation`

Keep separate:

- typed validation;
- capability availability;
- witness/source availability;
- model execution;
- realization conformance;
- compiler completeness;
- backend pattern evidence;
- linked-bundle execution;
- target consensus/policy results;
- event projection;
- attestation query;
- receipt accounting;
- calibration;
- release validation.

A report or status from one class never silently satisfies another.

In particular:

```text
target capability exists
≠
required evidence was produced

sponsor role structure is valid
≠
substrate conservation was evidenced

model relation is conformant
≠
deployment is ready
```

---

## 10. Verification matrix · `sec:backlog:verification`

### 10.1 Working cadence

For Rust changes:

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

Do not run the full Meson/release surface after every small edit.

Documentation-only changes do not require the Rust lane, but they still require
the relevant documentation and census checks.

### 10.2 Focused commands · `tbl:backlog:focused-tests`

| Area | Command |
|---|---|
| architecture/profile | `cargo test -p tripod-architecture` |
| realization | `cargo test -p tripod-realization` |
| compiler | `cargo test -p tripod-compiler` |
| compiler planning | `cargo test -p tripod-compiler proof` |
| compiler oracle | `cargo test -p tripod-compiler oracle` |
| model conformance | `cargo test -p tripod-model realization_conformance` |
| model bounds | `cargo test -p tripod-model bound_conformance` |
| artifacts | `cargo test -p tripod-artifacts` |
| labels/plans | `cargo test -p tripod-labels` |
| checker report/stamps | `cargo test -p cli-common` |
| document stamps | `cargo test -p tripod-document-stamps` |
| flattener | `cargo test -p flatten-latex-main` |
| process wrapper | `cargo test -p execwrap` |
| mocked Meson graph | `scripts/test-meson-mock.sh .` |

Focused filters supplement but never replace complete package and workspace
runs.

### 10.3 Full gate

After a completed batch:

```sh
scripts/ci.sh
meson compile -C build
meson test -C build --print-errorlogs
```

The canonical build directory is `build/`.

Use:

```sh
meson setup build
```

only if `build/` does not exist.

For a complete release-oriented result, additionally run the required MSRV and
stable lanes and the separate byte-reproducibility check:

```sh
scripts/check-document-reproducibility.sh
```

### 10.4 Documentation and census

```sh
scripts/check-plans.sh
meson compile -C build lint
git diff --check
git diff --cached --check
```

Every new tracked subject must join its nearest `meson.build` census.

### 10.5 Dependency and advisory evidence

```sh
cargo tree -e features
cargo metadata
cargo audit
```

A missing `cargo-audit` is recorded as skipped, never passed.

### 10.6 Clean repository

The final check is:

```sh
git status --porcelain=v1 --untracked-files=all
```

It must be empty.

### 10.7 Execution trust

Repository source, tests, Cargo manifests, Meson definitions, scripts, TeX,
and `.latexmkrc` are executable.

Untrusted contributions run only in an externally established,
credential-free isolated environment under ADR-015. A clean-tree result is a
correctness check, not malicious-code containment.

## 11. Current gate · `gate:backlog:current`

The Phase-2 gate is **passed**; the record is §2.11. The current gate is
Phase 3 — Elements target and foundational prototypes.

The Guide-8 target foundation is complete; the gate record is §2.12. The
Phase-3 task state is:

| ID | Status | Task |
|---|---|---|
| `T3-001` | DONE | Typed target package boundary |
| `T3-002` | DONE | Reviewed initial target definition |
| `T3-003` | DONE | Encoding and opcode contracts |
| `T3-004` | DONE | Development deployment binding |
| `T3-005` | DONE | Compiler capability adapter |
| `T3-006` | DONE | Target-native primitive conformance, gate record §2.13 |
| `T3-007` | DONE | Typed tapscript instruction foundation, gate record §2.13 |

Current blockers are:

```text
Phase-3 work:
    STATE-constructor prototype
    exact wide floor-arithmetic prototype
    public declassification prototype
```

Standing rules that survive the phase exit:

- Phases 1 and 2 remain evidence about their recorded trees;
- no compiler public complete-analysis API is frozen;
- no public realization/compiler digest is minted without a real consumer;
- target-specific fields remain forbidden in realization and compiler core;
- no stable linker or transaction ABI exists;
- no floating value or local graph handle enters semantic identity;
- no draft bound becomes deployment calibration;
- no raw report digest is treated as evidence identity without typed role and
  subject binding;
- no self-consistent model checkpoint is described as independent
  target-chain evidence;
- no architecture, model, realization, hash, build, or test success is
  described as deployment readiness;
- no current checkout is described as green without a fresh complete execution
  record.

---

## 12. Execution order · `sec:backlog:order`

Execute in this order unless reproduction changes dependencies:

```text
1. Charter the Phase-3 prototypes: the metadata-dependent STATE
   constructor, exact wide floor arithmetic, and public declassification,
   each prototype-only with its own target-native gate.
2. Keep target types out of compiler core; the target packages consume
   the analyzed boundary, never the reverse.
3. Mint no target hash and claim no production activation without a real
   consumer and reviewed evidence.
```

No new hash, target prototype, report field, or publication may defer a current
typed-boundary or correctness repair.

---

## 13. Backlog hygiene · `sec:backlog:hygiene`

### 13.1 Adding work · `rule:backlog:add`

A new task states:

- phase or lane;
- priority and status;
- dependencies;
- concrete output;
- assurance class;
- affected files and packages;
- focused exit test;
- verification command;
- identity and schema impact;
- dependency impact.

A new digest additionally satisfies ADR-016 admission.

### 13.2 Splitting work · `rule:backlog:split`

Split a task when it:

- crosses semantic, compiler, linker, target, transaction, evidence, or release
  ownership;
- mixes exact correctness with numerical diagnostics;
- mixes dependency adoption with algorithm acceptance;
- combines independent security consequences;
- contains one part that can complete while another remains research-blocked.

### 13.3 Dropping or parking work · `rule:backlog:drop`

A dropped or parked task records:

- why it is unnecessary or premature;
- supporting evidence;
- activation condition;
- replacement, if any;
- identity and release consequences.

“No present consumer” is sufficient reason to park an identity, report digest,
dependency, or publication.

### 13.4 Retention · `rule:backlog:retention`

After a phase or remediation series:

- move durable evidence into the owning phase card, ADR, decision, research
  result, release record, or annotated tag;
- retain permanent task IDs in compact tables;
- delete implementation diaries from the active backlog;
- rely on Git history rather than creating a second archive under `plans/`;
- keep only current and immediately preparatory work detailed here.

---

## 14. One-line backlog · `rem:backlog:one-line`

> Settle the STATE-constructor, wide-arithmetic, and declassification prototypes on the evidenced primitive substrate, without emitting operations, completing backend patterns, minting speculative identities, or claiming production activation.
